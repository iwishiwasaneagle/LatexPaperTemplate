  abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are predominantly evaluated by comparing their relative performance on a large suite of tasks. Most published results on deep RL benchmarks compare point estimates of aggregate performance such as mean and median scores across tasks, ignoring the statistical uncertainty implied by the use of a finite number of training runs. Beginning with the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE), the shift towards computationally-demanding benchmarks has led to the practice of evaluating only a small number of runs per task, exacerbating the statistical uncertainty in point estimates. In this paper, we argue that reliable evaluation in the few-run deep RL regime cannot ignore the uncertainty in results without running the risk of slowing down progress in the field. We illustrate this point using a case study on the Atari 100k benchmark, where we find substantial discrepancies between conclusions drawn from point estimates alone versus a more thorough statistical analysis. With the aim of increasing the field's confidence in reported results with a handful of runs, we advocate for reporting interval estimates of aggregate performance and propose performance profiles to account for the variability in results, as well as present more robust and efficient aggregate metrics, such as interquartile mean scores, to achieve small uncertainty in results. Using such statistical tools, we scrutinize performance evaluations of existing algorithms on other widely used RL benchmarks including the ALE, Procgen, and the DeepMind Control Suite, again revealing discrepancies in prior comparisons. Our findings call for a change in how we evaluate performance in deep RL, for which we present a more rigorous evaluation methodology, accompanied with an open-source library rliable2, to prevent unreliable results from stagnating the field.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Deep learning (DL) is revolutionizing evidence-based decision-making techniques that can be applied across various sectors. Specifically, it possesses the ability to utilize two or more levels of non-linear feature transformation of the given data via representation learning in order to overcome limitations posed by large datasets. As a multidisciplinary field that is still in its nascent phase, articles that survey DL architectures encompassing the full scope of the field are rather limited. Thus, this paper comprehensively reviews the state-of-art DL modelling techniques and provides insights into their advantages and challenges. It was found that many of the models exhibit a highly domain-specific efficiency and could be trained by two or more methods. However, training DL models can be very time-consuming, expensive, and requires huge samples for better accuracy. Since DL is also susceptible to deception and misclassification and tends to get stuck on local minima, improved optimization of parameters is required to create more robust models. Regardless, DL has already been leading to groundbreaking results in the healthcare, education, security, commercial, industrial, as well as government sectors. Some models, like the convolutional neural network (CNN), generative adversarial networks (GAN), recurrent neural network (RNN), recursive neural networks, and autoencoders, are frequently used, while the potential of other models remains widely unexplored. Pertinently, hybrid conventional DL architectures have the capacity to overcome the challenges experienced by conventional models. Considering that capsule architectures may dominate future DL models, this work aimed to compile information for stakeholders involved in the development and use of DL models in the contemporary world.},

However, traditional SAR decision-making schemes often adopt a fixed search path planning mode, but the limits are poor flexibility, low efficiency, and insufficient intelligence. This paper plans a search path with the shortest time-consuming and priority coverage of high-probability areas, considering complete coverage of maritime SAR areas and avoiding maritime obstacles. Firstly, a maritime SAR environment model is built using marine environmental field data and electronic charts. Secondly, an autonomous coverage path planning model for maritime SAR is proposed based on reinforcement learning, in which a reward function with multiple constraints is designed to guide the navigation action of the vessel agent. In the iterative training process of the path planning model, the random action selection probability is dynamically adjusted by the nonlinear action selection policy to ensure the stable convergence of the model. Finally, the experimental verification is conducted in different small-scale maritime SAR simulation scenarios. The results indicate that the search path can cover the high-probability areas preferentially with lower repeated coverage and shorter path length compared with other path planning algorithms.},

  abstract = {A waypoint trajectory is different from a continuous-path trajectory, e.g., a circular trajectory since the path between the waypoints is not constrained. However, continuous-path trajectories suffer from a major limitation, which is the inability to set any desired kinematic constraints on the trajectory other than the ones defined by the standard equation of the continuous-path trajectory, e.g., the circle equation. Therefore, this paper proposes the kinematically-constrained continuous-path polynomial trajectory to overcome this limitation. First, a framework to generate polynomial trajectories of any degree with an arbitrary number of waypoints in any dimensional space is presented. Second, a dynamic feasibility condition of the proposed trajectory for quadrotors applications is introduced. Third, the the required quadrotor's thrust is compared to the corresponding continuous-path trajectory to examine if the proposed trajectory requires larger thrust and consequently more energy consumption. Fourth, two different cases with arbitrary kinematic constraints and a piecewise kinematic profile are studied via simulation to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Finally, the results are validated experimentally. The results show effectiveness and the feasibility of the proposed approach.},

The core problem we address is efficient integration of the subspace force density over the 3D spatial domain. Similar to Gaussian quadrature schemes that efficiently integrate functions that lie in particular polynomial subspaces, we propose cubature schemes (multi-dimensional quadrature) optimized for efficient integration of force densities associated with particular subspace deformations, particular materials, and particular geometric domains. We support generic subspace deformation kinematics, and nonlinear hyperelastic materials. For an r-dimensional deformation subspace with O(r) cubature points, our method is able to evaluate sub-space forces at O(r2) cost. We also describe composite cubature rules for runtime error estimation. Results are provided for various subspace deformation models, several hyperelastic materials (St.Venant-Kirchhoff, Mooney-Rivlin, Arruda-Boyce), and multi-modal (graphics, haptics, sound) applications. We show dramatically better efficiency than traditional Monte Carlo integration.}

We present a novel technique called Hindsight Experience Replay which allows sample-efficient learning from rewards which are sparse and binary and therefore avoid the need for complicated reward engineering. It can be combined with an arbitrary off-policy RL algorithm and may be seen as a form of implicit curriculum. We demonstrate our approach on the task of manipulating objects with a robotic arm. In particular, we run experiments on three different tasks: pushing, sliding, and pick-and-place, in each case using only binary rewards indicating whether or not the task is completed. Our ablation studies show that Hindsight Experience Replay is a crucial ingredient which makes training possible in these challenging environments. We show that our policies trained on a physics simulation can be deployed on a physical robot and successfully complete the task.},

Only 70 papers were published in the 2000s compared to a total of 549 publications in the 2010s. However, the approaches and findings have yet to be systematically reviewed. In this work, the machine learning methods most commonly employed for modelling gasification and pyrolysis processes are discussed with reference to their applications, merits, and limitations. Whilst coefficients of determination (R2) can be difficult to compare directly, due to some studies having greatly different approaches and aims, most studies consistently achieved a high prediction accuracy with R2~{$>~$}0.90. Artificial neural networks have been most widely used due to their potential to learn highly non-linear input-output relationships. However, a variety of methods (e.g. regression methods, tree-based methods, and support vector machines) are appropriate depending on the application, data availability, model speed, etc. It is concluded that ML has great potential for the development of models with greater accuracy. Some advantages of machine learning models over existing models are their ability to incorporate relevant non-numerical parameters and the power to generate a multitude of solutions for a wide range of input parameters. More emphasis should be placed on model interpretability in order to better understand the processes being studied.},

However, the use of UAVs in these applications needs a substantial level of autonomy. In other words, UAVs should have the ability to accomplish planned missions in unexpected situations without requiring human intervention. To ensure this level of autonomy, many artificial intelligence algorithms were designed. These algorithms targeted the guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) of UAVs. In this paper, we described the state of the art of one subset of these algorithms: the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques. We made a detailed description of them, and we deduced the current limitations in this area. We noted that most of these DRL methods were designed to ensure stable and smooth UAV navigation by training computer-simulated environments. We realized that further research efforts are needed to address the challenges that restrain their deployment in real-life scenarios.},

  abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

With rapid evolution of autoencoder methods, there has yet to be a complete study that provides a full autoencoders roadmap for both stimulating technical improvements and orienting research newbies to autoencoders. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of autoencoders, starting with an explanation of the principle of conventional autoencoder and their primary development process. We then provide a taxonomy of autoencoders based on their structures and principles and thoroughly analyze and discuss the related models. Furthermore, we review the applications of autoencoders in various fields, including machine vision, natural language processing, complex network, recommender system, speech process, anomaly detection, and others. Lastly, we summarize the limitations of current autoencoder algorithms and discuss the future directions of the field.},

A FORTRAN implementation of the algorithm is included. The basic cubature rule used over each triangle is a 37-point symmetric rule of degree 13. Based on the same evaluation points the local error for each element in the approximation vector and for each triangle is computed using a sequence of null rule evaluations. A sophisticated error-estimation procedure tries, in a cautious manner, to decide whether we have asymptotic behavior locally for each function. Different actions are taken depending on that decision, and the procedure takes advantage of the basic rule's polynomial degree when computing the error estimate in the asymptotic case.},

Furthermore, the lack of a viable tactile sensor capable of sensing over the entire area of the hand impedes the rich, low-level feedback that would improve learning of dexterous manipulation skills. This paper introduces an inexpensive, modular, robust, and scalable platform -- the DManus -- aimed at resolving these challenges while satisfying the large-scale data collection capabilities demanded by deep robot learning paradigms. Studies on human manipulation point to the criticality of low-level tactile feedback in performing everyday dexterous tasks. The DManus comes with ReSkin sensing on the entire surface of the palm as well as the fingertips. We demonstrate effectiveness of the fully integrated system in a tactile aware task -- bin picking and sorting.

The problem of planning suitable trajectories is relevant not only for the proper use of these machines, in order to avoid undesired effects such as vibrations or even damages on the mechanical structure, but also in some phases of their design and in the choice and sizing of the actuators. This is particularly true now that the concept of "electronic cams" has replaced, in the design of automatic machines, the classical approach based on "mechanical cams". The choice of a particular trajectory has direct and relevant implications on several aspects of the design and use of an automatic machine, like the dimensioning of the actuators and of the reduction gears, the vibrations and efforts generated on the machine and on the load, the tracking errors during the motion execution. For these reasons, in order to understand and appreciate the peculiarities of the different techniques available for trajectory planning, besides the mathematical aspects of their implementation also a detailed analysis in the time and frequency domains, a comparison of their main properties under different points of view, and general considerations related to their practical use are reported. {\copyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2008.

  abstract = {Regular grids or lattices are frequently used to study ecosystems, for observations, experiments and simulations. The regular rectangular or square grid is used more often than the hexagonal grid, but their relative merits have been little discussed. Here we compare rectangular and hexagonal grids for ecological applications. We focus on the reasons some researchers have preferred hexagonal grids and methods to facilitate the use of hexagonal grids. We consider modelling and other applications, including the role of nearest neighbourhood in experimental design, the representation of connectivity in maps, and a new method for performing field surveys using hexagonal grids, which was demonstrated on montane heath vegetation. The rectangular grid is generally preferred because of its symmetrical, orthogonal co-ordinate system and the frequent use of rasters from Geographic Information Systems. Cells in a rectangular grid can also easily be combined to produce new grids with lower resolutions. However, efficient co-ordinate systems and multi-resolution partitions using the hexagonal grid are available. The nearest neighbourhood in a hexagonal grid is simpler and less ambiguous than in a rectangular grid. When nearest neighbourhood, movement paths or connectivity are important, the rectangular grid may not be suitable. We also investigate important differences between visualizations using hexagonal and rectangular grids. A survey of recent uses of grids in Ecological Modelling suggested that hexagonal grids are rarely used, even in applications for which they are more suitable than rectangular grids, e.g. connectivity and movement paths. Researchers should consider their choice of grid at an early stage in project development, and authors should explain the reasons for their choices.},

Popular models that learn such representations ignore the morphology of words, by assigning a distinct vector to each word. This is a limitation, especially for languages with large vocabularies and many rare words. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on the skipgram model, where each word is represented as a bag of character n-grams. A vector representation is associated to each character n-gram; words being represented as the sum of these representations. Our method is fast, allowing to train models on large corpora quickly and allows us to compute word representations for words that did not appear in the training data. We evaluate our word representations on nine different languages, both on word similarity and analogy tasks. By comparing to recently proposed morphological word representations, we show that our vectors achieve state-of-the-art performance on these tasks.},

This article presents an approach for the optimization of a UAV's trajectory for maritime radar wide area persistent surveillance to simultaneously minimize fuel consumption, maximize mean probability of detection, and minimize mean revisit time. Quintic polynomials are used to generate UAV trajectories due to their ability to provide complete and complex solutions while requiring few inputs. Furthermore, the UAV dynamics and surveillance mission requirements are used to ensure that a trajectory is realistic and mission compatible. A wide area search radar model is used within this article in conjunction with a discretized grid in order to determine the search area's mean probability of detection and mean revisit time. The trajectory generation method is then used in conjunction with a multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm to obtain a global optimum in terms of path, airspeed (and thus time), and altitude. The performance of the approach is then tested over two common maritime surveillance scenarios and compared to an industry recommended baseline.},

We tested the hypothesis that walking would be most expensive for obese women compared with obese men and normal-weight women and men. Furthermore, we hypothesized that for all groups, preferred walking speed would correspond to the speed that minimized the gross energy cost per distance. We measured body composition, maximal oxygen consumption, and preferred walking speed of 39 (19 class II obese, 20 normal weight) women and men. We also measured oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production while the subjects walked on a level treadmill at six speeds (0.50--1.75 m/s). Both obesity and sex affected the net metabolic rate (W/kg) of walking. Net metabolic rates of obese subjects were only {$\sim$}10\% greater (per kg) than for normal-weight subjects, and net metabolic rates for women were {$\sim$}10\% greater than for men. The increase in net metabolic rate at faster walking speeds was greatest in obese women compared with the other groups. Preferred walking speed was not different across groups (1.42 m/s) and was near the speed that minimized gross energy cost per distance. Surprisingly, mass distribution (thigh mass/body mass) was not related to net metabolic rate, but body composition (\% fat) was ( r               2               = 0.43).

This field, which can be discrete or continuous, is subject to diffusion and decay. Furthermore it can be modified by the motion of the pedestrians. Therefore, the model uses an idea similar to chemotaxis, but with pedestrians following a virtual rather than a chemical trace. Our main goal is to show that the introduction of such a floor field is sufficient to model collective effects and self-organization encountered in pedestrian dynamics, e.g. lane formation in counterflow through a large corridor. As an application we also present simulations of the evacuation of a large room with reduced visibility, e.g. due to failure of lights or smoke.},

This paper reports computational results showing that the two-dimensional minimization approach gives nearly optimal reductions in the n-dimension quadratic model over a wide range of test cases. We also show that there is very little difference, in efficiency and reliability, between using the approximate or exact trust region step in solving standard test problems for unconstrained optimisation.

Death was attributed to drowning from an inability to stay afloat and vague terms, such as exposure. This is because death at sea was, and to some degree still is considered an occupational hazard. Fishermen for instance, who are most at risk, simply considered it as on occupational hazard and fate. Any attempt at protection was to float the person in rather than out of the water. 2. It took until the middle of the Second World War for the UK and Germany, and post-Korean war for the US to realize that there was a problem from sudden cold water immersion. 3. As a result, internationally over the last half of the 20th century, there has been considerable human experimentation in cold water physiology. The pioneering work was done in the mid- 1940s and 1950s, but by the 1960s, it appears to have been forgotten and needed to be relearned. The advent of the offshore oil industry created a demand for more research to produce better immersion suits. This created a flurry of experimentation in the 1980s and 1990s. A number of these experiments have been cited to give the reader the wide scope of them.},

  abstract = {For a number of applications, including real/time damage diagnostics as well as control, online methods, i.e., methods which may be implemented on-the-fly, are necessary. Within a system identification context, this implies adoption of filtering algorithms, typically of the Kalman or Bayesian class. For engineered structures, damage or deterioration may often manifest in relation to phenomena such as fracture, plasticity, impact, or friction. Despite the different nature of the previous phenomena, they are described by a common denominator: switching behavior upon occurrence of discrete events. Such events include for example, crack initiation, transitions between elastic and plastic response, or between stick and slide modes. Typically, the state-space equations of such models are non-differentiable at such events, rendering the corresponding systems non-smooth. Identification of non-smooth systems poses greater difficulties than smooth problems of similar computational complexity. Up to a certain extent, this may be attributed to the varying identifiability of such systems, which violates a basic requirement of online Bayesian Identification algorithms, thus affecting their convergence for non-smooth problems. Herein, a treatment to this problem is proposed by the authors, termed the Discontinuous D-- modification, where unidentifiable parameters are acknowledged and temporarily excluded from the problem formulation. In this work, the D-- modification is illustrated for the case of the Unscented Kalman Filter UKF, resulting in a method termed DUKF, proving superior performance to the conventional, and widely adopted, alternative.}

The output of the network is computed using a black-box differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models.},

One key issue is to generate consistent trajectory predictions without colliding. To overcome the challenge, we propose an efficient masked autoencoder for trajectory prediction (Traj-MAE) that better represents the complicated behaviors of agents in the driving environment. Specifically, our Traj-MAE employs diverse masking strategies to pre-train the trajectory encoder and map encoder, allowing for the capture of social and temporal information among agents while leveraging the effect of environment from multiple granularities. To address the catastrophic forgetting problem that arises when pre-training the network with multiple masking strategies, we introduce a continual pre-training framework, which can help Traj-MAE learn valuable and diverse information from various strategies efficiently. Our experimental results in both multi-agent and single-agent settings demonstrate that Traj-MAE achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art methods and significantly outperforms our baseline model.},

In the case of 2D path planning, a feasible flight path connecting the start and goal point can be regarded as a separating surface that divides the space into two regions. This suggests a dual problem of first dividing the whole space into such two regions and then picking up the boundary as a path. We use support vector machine to solve this dual problem. SVM can generate a nonlinear separating surface based on the margin maximization principle. First, we generate a novel search space which contains flyable and no-fly regions from 3D surface of minimum risk and pick up key obstacle points as samples. Second, a safe and smooth path is generated through SVM. Results from simulations show that the path planner is able to plan an optimal path efficiently due to the simplicity of the search space.},

This matches the time required to build an arbitrary (unconstrained) Delaunay triangulation and the time required to build an arbitrary constrained (non-Delaunay) triagulation. CDTs, because of their relationship with Delaunay triangulations, have a number of properties that make them useful for the finite-element method. Applications also include motion planning in the presence of polygonal obstacles and constrained Euclidean minimum spanning trees, spanning trees subject to the restriction that some edges are prespecified.},

  abstract = {Information plays a basic role in decision making processes. In particular in the emergency management and SAR (Search and Rescue) operations, it is extremely important to take into account and use correctly as much information as possible to maximise the possibility of making the right decisions. Quite often decision makers do not consider all the available information. Moreover, cognitive biases cause several errors in the decision making process. These are some of the reasons that justify the effort for trying to build a decision support system, based on a normative approach to the decisionmaking, to manage mountain missing person search. Since cognitive biases influence the way the rescue squads act, and the environment affects the way a lost person thinks and moves, it is possible to start the design of a decision support system by trying to evaluate in a combined way both environmental and individual variables. The more natural and logical way to manage environmental information, i.e. geographical data, is to use GIS (Geographic Information Systems), while the best way to model the behaviour of lost people is to study the way they think and act. The implementation in a GIS allows the integration and the management of different kind of information.},

BTs are a very efficient way of creating complex systems that are both modular and reactive. These properties are crucial in many applications, which has led to the spread of BT from computer game programming to many branches of AI and Robotics. In this book, we will first give an introduction to BTs, then we describe how BTs relate to, and in many cases generalize, earlier switching structures. These ideas are then used as a foundation for a set of efficient and easy to use design principles. Properties such as safety, robustness, and efficiency are important for an autonomous system, and we describe a set of tools for formally analyzing these using a state space description of BTs. With the new analysis tools, we can formalize the descriptions of how BTs generalize earlier approaches. We also show the use of BTs in automated planning and machine learning. Finally, we describe an extended set of tools to capture the behavior of Stochastic BTs, where the outcomes of actions are described by probabilities. These tools enable the computation of both success probabilities and time to completion.},

On the other hand, Behavior Trees (BTs) represent a valid alternative to FSMs presenting many advantages in terms of modularity, reactiveness, scalability and domain-independence. In this paper, we propose a model-free AP framework using Genetic Programming (GP) to derive an optimal BT for an autonomous agent to achieve a given goal in unknown (but fully observable) environments. We illustrate the proposed framework using experiments conducted with an open source benchmark Mario AI for automated generation of BTs that can play the game character Mario to complete a certain level at various levels of difficulty to include enemies and obstacles.},

SAGA is coded in C++ in an object oriented design and runs under several operating systems including Windows and Linux. Key functional features of the modular software architecture comprise an application programming interface for the development and implementation of new geoscientific methods, a user friendly graphical user interface with many visualization options, a command line interpreter, and interfaces to interpreted languages like R and Python. The current version 2.1.4 offers more than 600 tools, which are implemented in dynamically loadable libraries or shared objects and represent the broad scopes of SAGA in numerous fields of geoscientific endeavor and beyond. In this paper, we inform about the system's architecture, functionality, and its current state of development and implementation. Furthermore, we highlight the wide spectrum of scientific applications of SAGA in a review of published studies, with special emphasis on the core application areas digital terrain analysis, geomorphology, soil science, climatology and meteorology, as well as remote sensing.},

  abstract = {In this work, we present the Text Conditioned Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network, (TAC-GAN) a text to image Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for synthesizing images from their text descriptions. Former approaches have tried to condition the generative process on the textual data; but allying it to the usage of class information, known to diversify the generated samples and improve their structural coherence, has not been explored. We trained the presented TAC-GAN model on the Oxford-102 dataset of flowers, and evaluated the discriminability of the generated images with Inception-Score, as well as their diversity using the Multi-Scale Structural Similarity Index (MS-SSIM). Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art models, i.e., its inception score is 3.45, corresponding to a relative increase of 7.8\% compared to the recently introduced StackGan. A comparison of the mean MS-SSIM scores of the training and generated samples per class shows that our approach is able to generate highly diverse images with an average MS-SSIM of 0.14 over all generated classes.},

  abstract = {Many real-world search and optimisation problems involve inequality and/or equality constraints and are thus posed as constrained optimisation problems. In trying to solve constrained optimisation problems using genetic algorithms (GAs) or classical optimisation methods, penalty function methods have been the most popular approach, because of their simplicity and ease of implementation. However, since the penalty function approach is generic and applicable to any type of constraint (linear or nonlinear), their performance is not always satisfactory. Thus, researchers have developed sophisticated penalty functions specific to the problem at hand and the search algorithm used for optimisation. However, the most difficult aspect of the penalty function approach is to find appropriate penalty parameters needed to guide the search towards the constrained optimum. In this paper, GA's population-based approach and ability to make pair-wise comparison in tournament selection operator are exploited to devise a penalty function approach that does not require any penalty parameter. Careful comparisons among feasible and infeasible solutions are made so as to provide a search direction towards the feasible region. Once sufficient feasible solutions are found, a niching method (along with a controlled mutation operator) is used to maintain diversity among feasible solutions. This allows a real-parameter GA's crossover operator to continuously find better feasible solutions, gradually leading the search near the true optimum solution. GAs with this constraint handling approach have been tested on nine problems commonly used in the literature, including an engineering design problem. In all cases, the proposed approach has been able to repeatedly find solutions closer to the true optimum solution than that reported earlier. {\copyright} 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.},

Methods exist for generating input parameters for model realizations including Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) and Latin hypercube sampling (LHS). Recent algorithms such as maximinLHS seek to maximize the minimum distance between model inputs in the multivariate space. A novel extension of Latin hypercube sampling (LHSMDU) for multivariate models is developed here that increases the multidimensional uniformity of the input parameters through sequential realization elimination. Correlations are considered in the LHSMDU sampling matrix using a Cholesky decomposition of the correlation matrix. Computer code implementing the proposed algorithm supplements this article. A simulation study comparing MCS, LHS, maximinLHS and LHSMDU demonstrates that increased multidimensional uniformity can significantly improve realization efficiency and that LHSMDU is effective for large multivariate problems.},

Recently, behaviour trees have come to the forefront of games AI technology, providing a more intuitive approach than previous techniques such as hierarchical state machines, which often required complex data structures producing poorly structured code when scaled up. The design and creation of behaviour trees, however, requires experience and effort. This research introduces Q-learning behaviour trees (QL-BT), a method for the application of reinforcement learning to behaviour tree design. The technique facilitates AI designers' use of behaviour trees by assisting them in identifying the most appropriate moment to execute each branch of AI logic, as well as providing an implementation that can be used to debug, analyse and optimize early behaviour tree prototypes. Initial experiments demonstrate that behaviour trees produced by the QL-BT algorithm effectively integrate RL, automate tree design, and are human-readable.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a probabilistic approach to the problem of mission planning for UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) flying through an area of multiple sources of threat. As the first step, this new approach is used in path planning. It is assumed that the probabilistic map of the area of operation is available during the mission. Probabilistic map is defined as the risk of exposure to the sources of threat as a function of position. In the path planning, the objective is to go to a target location along the shortest possible path with an acceptable probability of getting disabled or along an acceptably long path with the lowest possible probability of getting disabled. Depending on the definition of threat, a UAV is considered "disabled" by a source of threat when it is detected, hit or shut down. The conditional probability of a UAV getting disabled under the condition that it follows a certain path is defined and formulated based on the probabilistic map of the area. Then, two strategies that lead a UAV to the target through the area of operation is developed. The strategies use the local information of the probabilistic map and the information about the location of the target. They are parameterized to change the weighting on finding a shorter path or finding a path with smaller probability of getting disabled. Finally, the strategies are implemented in a case study to illustrate the application of the probabilistic approach. The paper includes a discussion on using the probabilistic approach in other phases of mission planning for multiple UAVs.},

Thus an understanding of the complex relationship between demographics and physical geography could enhance the responders' ability to locate the subject in a timely manner. Various global datasets have been organized to provide general distance and feature based geostatistical methods for describing this relationship. However, there is some question as to the applicability of these generalized datasets to local incidents that are dominated by a specific physical geography. This study consists of two primary objectives related to the allocation of geographic probability intended to manage the overall size of the search area. The first objective considers the applicability of a global dataset of lost person incidents to a localized environment with limited geographic diversity. This is followed by a comparison between a commonly used Euclidean distance statistic and an alternative travel-cost model that accounts for the influence of anthropogenic and landscape features on subject mobility and travel time. In both instances, lost person incident data from years 2000 to 2010 for Yosemite National Park is used and compared to a large pool of internationally compiled cases consisting of similar subject profiles.},

  abstract = {Every year thousands of people are reported lost or missing in wilderness areas and in response, a search and rescue (SAR) operation is launched to locate, stabilize, and extract those missing. Actually locating the subject is often the most difficult of these processes. This study attempts to improve upon search operations by analyzing lost person behavior at the "local" level. If a search manager knew what a lost subject was most likely to do when lost, then they could plan the search accordingly and return them to safety much quicker. Additionally, if National Park officials knew who was becoming lost, and when and where this occurred, steps could be taken to prevent these people from becoming lost in the first place. Eleven years (2000-2010) of Search and Rescue case incident reports from Yosemite National Park (2,308 in total) were examined and 213 searches were retained for analysis. It was determined that approximately 62\% of incidents involve missing hikers. Nearly two thirds of the searches were for one subject and about two-thirds of these involved males. The mean age of missing persons was 36 years old. Most people were reported missing in July, on Saturday, and between the hours of 2 and 3 p.m. Almost half of people reported as missing were actually lost while others were merely separated from their party, or overdue. Contributing factors include losing the trail accidentally, failure to communicate the intended plan, and miscalculating the time or distance of the planned route, among others. Within a Geographic Information System (GIS) the Initial Planning Point (IPP), the point at which the person was last seen or known to be, and the found location was georeferenced for each incident using the point radius method. This allowed for a Getis-Ord Gi* analysis to be conducted of both the IPPs and found locations and "hot spots" were identified for each. The GIS also provided an environment for analyzing lost person behavior. Within Yosemite National Park lost hikers most often utilized route traveling in order to reorient themselves. Additionally, descriptive lost person behavior statistics for hikers were calculated, including: horizontal distance from the IPP to the found location, vertical elevation change from the IPP to the found location, dispersion angle from intended destination to the found location, and the track offset of the found location. These "local" results were then compared to "international" statistics presented by the International Search and Rescue Incident Database (ISRID) using a chi-square goodness of fit test. It was found that the ISRID data provided for horizontal distance from the IPP and track offset were not suitable for use in Yosemite while the data pertaining to vertical elevation change from the IPP and the dispersion angle could potentially be utilized for search planning.},

One critical role of Geographic Information Systems (GISs) is to define the boundaries that define the search area. The literature mostly focuses on ring- and area-based methods but lacks a linear/network approach. The purpose of this paper is to present a novel network approach that will benefit search planners by saving time, requires less data layers and provides better results. Design/methodology/approach The paper compares two existing models (Ring Model, Travel Time Cost Surface Model (TTCSM)) against a new network model (Travel Time Network Model) by using a case study from a mountainous area in Austria. Newest data from the International Search and Rescue Incident Database are used for all three models. Advantages and disadvantages of each model are evaluated. Findings Network analyses offer a fruitful alternative to the Ring Model and the TTCSM for estimating search areas, especially for regions with comprehensive trail/road networks. Furthermore, only few basic data are needed for quick calculation. Practical implications The paper supports GIS network analyses for wildland search and rescue operations to raise the survival chances of missing persons due to optimizing search area estimation. Originality/value The paper demonstrates the value of the novel network approach, which requires fewer GIS layers and less time to generate a solution. Furthermore, the paper provides a comparison between all three potential models.},

The use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can significantly improve the performance of search and rescue operations. However, planning the search paths of UAVs can be a highly complex optimization problem, and one of the most challenging tasks in the problem formulation is the estimation of target location probability distribution over time. This paper presents a problem of scheduling multiple UAVs to search for missing tourists and proposes a method for estimating tourist location probabilities which change with topographic features, weather conditions, and time. To solve the problem efficiently, we propose a hybrid evolutionary algorithm which consists of the main algorithm and a sub-algorithm. The main algorithm uses specific migration and mutation operators to evolve a population of main solutions, and the sub-algorithm combines a problem-specific heuristic and tabu search method to optimize each UAV path. The experimental results on a wide variety of test instances (including five real-world instances) demonstrate the performance advantages of the proposed method.}

  abstract = {Disaster management, search and rescue missions, and health monitoring are examples of critical applications that require object localization with high precision and sometimes in a timely manner. In the absence of the global positioning system (GPS), the radio received signal strength index (RSSI) can be used for localization purposes due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness. However, due to the low accuracy of RSSI, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones may be used as an efficient solution for improved localization accuracy due to their agility and higher probability of line-of-sight (LoS). Hence, in this context, we propose a novel framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) to enable a UAV (agent) to autonomously find its trajectory that results in improving the localization accuracy of multiple objects in shortest time and path length, fewer signal-strength measurements (waypoints), and/or lower UAV energy consumption. In particular, we first control the agent through initial scan trajectory on the whole region to 1) know the number of nodes and estimate their initial locations, and 2) train the agent online during operation. Then, the agent forms its trajectory by using RL to choose the next waypoints in order to minimize the average location errors of all objects. Our framework includes detailed UAV to ground channel characteristics with an empirical path loss and log-normal shadowing model, and also with an elaborate energy consumption model. We investigate and compare the localization precision of our approach with existing methods from the literature by varying the UAV's trajectory length, energy, number of waypoints, and time. Furthermore, we study the impact of the UAV's velocity, altitude, hovering time, communication range, number of maximum RSSI measurements, and number of objects. The results show the superiority of our method over the state-of-art and demonstrates its fast reduction of the localization error.},

However, the process of hyperparameter optimization still varies widely across papers, which makes it challenging to compare RL algorithms fairly. In this paper, we show that hyperparameter choices in RL can significantly affect the agent's final performance and sample efficiency, and that the hyperparameter landscape can strongly depend on the tuning seed which may lead to overfitting. We therefore propose adopting established best practices from AutoML, such as the separation of tuning and testing seeds, as well as principled hyperparameter optimization (HPO) across a broad search space. We support this by comparing multiple state-of-theart HPO tools on a range of RL algorithms and environments to their hand-tuned counterparts, demonstrating that HPO approaches often have higher performance and lower compute overhead. As a result of our findings, we recommend a set of best practices for the RL community, which should result in stronger empirical results with fewer computational costs, better reproducibility, and thus faster progress. In order to encourage the adoption of these practices, we provide plug-andplay implementations of the tuning algorithms used in this paper at https://github.com/ facebookresearch/how-to-autorl.},

CLC service has a long-time heritage (formerly known as "CORINE Land Cover Programme"), coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA). It provides consistent and thematically detailed information on land cover and land cover changes across Europe. CLC datasets are based on the classification of satellite images produced by the national teams of the participating countries - the EEA members and cooperating countries (EEA39). National CLC inventories are then further integrated into a seamless land cover map of Europe. The resulting European database relies on standard methodology and nomenclature with following base parameters: 44 classes in the hierarchical 3-level CLC nomenclature; minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 hectares; minimum width of linear elements is 100 metres.

For example, a reinforcement learning agent may prefer states where a sensory error gives it the maximum reward, but where the true reward is actually small. We formalise this problem as a generalised Markov Decision Problem called Corrupt Reward MDP. Traditional RL methods fare poorly in CRMDPs, even under strong simplifying assumptions and when trying to compensate for the possibly corrupt rewards. Two ways around the problem are investigated. First, by giving the agent richer data, such as in inverse reinforcement learning and semi-supervised reinforcement learning, reward corruption stemming from systematic sensory errors may sometimes be completely managed. Second, by using randomisation to blunt the agent's optimisation, reward corruption can be partially managed under some assumptions.},

  abstract = {Search and Rescue (SAR) of vulnerable missing persons is unfortunately a common task for the Police and other emergency services. Organisations like the Centre for Search and Rescue (CSR)[1] carry out research into the typical behaviour patterns for classes of missing person (young child, elderly person with dementia etc.) and provide specialist training to Police forces in all areas related to SAR. The category of missing person is mapped to a behavioural or psychological profile that is used to refine the search, indicating buildings or landmarks that the person is most likely to be. One of the key outcomes from all studies into the effectiveness of missing person search strategies is that time is crucial - the quicker the person is found, the more likely a favourable outcome. With the rapid development and expansion of the drone sector over the last decade, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become cheaper and more accessible than ever before. Officers from the Air Support Unit of Police Scotland are one of the first emergency services in the UK to take advantage of this technology by using infrared and visible light cameras on commercially available quadrotors as an aid to the current single manned helicopter. Current plans are to use single UAV platforms to search a pre-defined area, to detect possible targets and direct the search team, although swarms of vehicles are also being considered for future use. However, their flight plans are made solely by instinct and training and this provides a unique opportunity to use a priori information to create optimised coverage paths. However, if little thought is given to the path planning algorithm it may well be suboptimal intime sensitive scenarios. Therefore, it is imperative to find the optimum path for the scenario tomobilise ground units as fast as possible. Research has been conducted in this field, with themost promising using the Bayesian search theory which is based on the Bayesian statisticswhere probability expresses adegree of beliefin an event. This search theory has been usedfor SAR efforts previously, such as in the MH370 incident of 2011[2]. For the use in drones, thistheory can be used to construct coverage paths using various greedy path planning algorithmsand numerical optimisation methods. This repository implements algorithms from [3], [4] and [5] as well as implementing a custom area coverage algorithm based on probability accumulation based optimisation.},

Recently, Police Scotland Air Support Unit have begun the deployment of drones to assist in missing person search with success, although the efficacy of the search relies upon the expertise of the drone operator. In this paper, several algorithms for planning the search path are compared to determine which approach has the highest probability of finding the missing person in the shortest time. In addition to this, the use of {\textbackslash}'a priori psychological profile information of the subject to create a probability map of likely locations within the search area was explored. This map is then used within a non-linear optimisation to determine the optimal flight path for a given search area and subject profile. Two optimisation solvers were compared; genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimisation. Finally, the most effective algorithm was used to create a coverage path for a real-life location, for which Police Scotland Air Support Unit completed multiple test flights. The generated flight paths based on the predicted intent of the lost person were found to perform statistically better than those of the expert police operators.},

The probability distribution map depicting the potential location of the lost person emerges through a combination of Monte Carlo simulations and mobility-time-based sampling. Validation of the model is achieved using real-world Search and Rescue data to train a Gaussian Process model. This allows generalization of the data to sample initial starting points for the agents during validation. Comparative analysis with historical data showcases promising outcomes relative to alternative methods.

This article attempts to partly fill this gap by providing quantitative and objective comparisons of four widely-used simulation packages for mobile robots. The comparisons reported here were conducted by obtaining data from a real Husky A200 mobile robot driving on mixed terrains as ground truth and by simulating a 3D mobile robot model in a developed identical simulation world of these terrains for each simulator. We then compared the simulation outputs with real, measured results by weighted metrics. Based on our experiments and selected metrics, we conclude that CoppeliaSim is currently the best performing simulator, although Gazebo is not far behind and is a good alternative.},

We therefore present a systematic and extensive analysis of experience replay in Q-learning methods, focusing on two fundamental properties: the replay capacity and the ratio of learning updates to experience collected (replay ratio). Our additive and ablative studies upend conventional wisdom around experience replay -- greater capacity is found to substantially increase the performance of certain algorithms, while leaving others unaffected. Counterintuitively we show that theoretically ungrounded, uncorrected n-step returns are uniquely beneficial while other techniques confer limited benefit for sifting through larger memory. Separately, by directly controlling the replay ratio we contextualize previous observations in the literature and empirically measure its importance across a variety of deep RL algorithms. Finally, we conclude by testing a set of hypotheses on the nature of these performance benefits.},

The probabilistic leeway model is implemented to find the location of the PIW and a Deep Learning object detection algorithm (Faster R-CNN) is employed to locate the PIW. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a search system on-board a vessel -capable of live planning and execution- is proposed.

  abstract = {Model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, such as Q-learning, perform poorly in the early stages of learning in noisy environments, because much effort is spent unlearning biased estimates of the state-action value function. The bias results from selecting, among several noisy estimates, the apparent optimum, which may actually be suboptimal. We propose G-learning, a new off-policy learning algorithm that regularizes the value estimates by penalizing deterministic policies in the beginning of the learning process. We show that this method reduces the bias of the value-function estimation, leading to faster convergence to the optimal value and the optimal policy. Moreover, G-learning enables the natural incorporation of prior domain knowledge, when available. The stochastic nature of G-learning also makes it avoid some exploration costs, a property usually attributed only to on-policy algorithms. We illustrate these ideas in several examples, where G-learning results in significant improvements of the convergence rate and the cost of the learning process.},

  abstract = {The aim of this article is to present a novel quaternion based control scheme for the attitude control problem of a quadrotor. A quaternion is a hyper complex number of rank 4 that can be utilized to avoid the inherent geometrical singularity when representing rigid body dynamics with Euler angles or the complexity of having coupled differential equations with the Direction Cosine Matrix (DCM). In the presented approach both the quadrotor's attitude model and the proposed non-linear Proportional squared (P 2) control algorithm have been implemented in the quaternion space, without any transformations and calculations in the Euler's angle space or DCM. Throughout the article, the merits of the proposed novel approach are being analyzed and discussed, while the efficacy of the suggested novel quaternion based controller are being evaluated by extended simulation results.},

  abstract = {Despite advances in scalable models, the inference tools used for Gaussian processes (GPs) have yet to fully capitalize on developments in computing hardware. We present an efficient and general approach to GP inference based on Blackbox Matrix-Matrix multiplication (BBMM). BBMM inference uses a modified batched version of the conjugate gradients algorithm to derive all terms for training and inference in a single call. BBMM reduces the asymptotic complexity of exact GP inference from \$O(n{\textasciicircum}3)\$ to \$O(n{\textasciicircum}2)\$. Adapting this algorithm to scalable approximations and complex GP models simply requires a routine for efficient matrix-matrix multiplication with the kernel and its derivative. In addition, BBMM uses a specialized preconditioner to substantially speed up convergence. In experiments we show that BBMM effectively uses GPU hardware to dramatically accelerate both exact GP inference and scalable approximations. Additionally, we provide GPyTorch, a software platform for scalable GP inference via BBMM, built on PyTorch.},

  abstract = {Humans have evolved the ability to walk very efficiently. Further, humans prefer to walk at speeds that approximately minimize their metabolic energy expenditure per unit distance (i.e. gross cost of transport, COT). This has been found in a variety of population groups and other species. However, these studies were mostly performed on smooth, level ground or on treadmills. We hypothesized that the objective function for walking is more complex than only minimizing the COT. To test this idea, we compared the preferred speeds and the relationships between COT and speed for people walking on both a smooth, level floor and a rough, natural terrain trail. Rough terrain presumably introduces other factors, such as stability, to the objective function. Ten healthy men walked on both a straight, flat, smooth floor and an outdoor trail strewn with rocks and boulders. In both locations, subjects performed five to seven trials at different speeds relative to their preferred speed. The COT--speed relationships were similarly U-shaped for both surfaces, but the COT values on rough terrain were approximately 115\% greater. On the smooth surface, the preferred speed (1.24{\textpm}0.17 m s-1) was not found to be statistically different (P=0.09) than the speed that minimized COT (1.34{\textpm}0.03 m s-1). On rough terrain, the preferred speed (1.07{\textpm}0.05 m s-1) was significantly slower than the COT minimum speed (1.13{\textpm}0.07 m s-1; P=0.02). Because near the optimum speed the COT function is very shallow, these changes in speed result in a small change in COT (0.5\%). It appears that the objective function for speed preference when walking on rough terrain includes COT and additional factors such as stability.},

Existing works focus on finding the shortest path solution or using metrics such as safety and energy consumption to determine the planning. It is noted that most of these studies rely on prior knowledge of road network, which may be not available in certain situations. In this paper, we design a route planning algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for pedestrians. We use travel time consumption as the metric, and plan the route by predicting pedestrian flow in the road network. We put an agent, which is an intelligent robot, on a virtual map. Different from previous studies, our approach assumes that the agent does not need any prior information about road network, but simply relies on the interaction with the environment. We propose a dynamically adjustable route planning (DARP) algorithm, where the agent learns strategies through a dueling deep Q network to avoid congested roads. Simulation results show that the DARP algorithm saves 52\% of the time under congestion condition when compared with traditional shortest path planning algorithms.},

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

We consider a range of signals derived from two distinct indicators of learning progress: rate of increase in prediction accuracy, and rate of increase in network complexity. Experimental results for LSTM networks on three curricula demonstrate that our approach can significantly accelerate learning, in some cases halving the time required to attain a satisfactory performance level.},

  abstract = {Up to now, the inaccurate supervision problem caused by label noises poses a big challenge for regression modeling. Regularized noise-robust models provide a valid way for dealing with label noises in regression tasks. They generally use robust losses to cope with label noises and further enhance model robustness by feature selection. But most of them may not work well on data sets contaminated by severe noises (whose magnitudes are extreme), because severe noises do not coincide with their noise assumptions. To address this concern, this paper proposes a robust adaptive linear regression method named TC-ALASSO (Truncated Cauchy Adaptive LASSO), in which model learning and feature selection are finished simultaneously. The fat-tailed Cauchy distribution and truncation theory are adopted to deal with moderate noises and identified extreme noises, respectively, and construct the Truncated Cauchy loss for regression tasks. Moreover, TC-ALASSO applies the adaptive regularizer to finish feature selection well. Note that its adaptive regularizer weights are acquired according to regression coefficient estimations under the truncated Cauchy loss. We also theoretically analyze the robustness of proposed TC-ALASSO in this paper. The experimental results on artificial and benchmark data sets all confirm the robustness and effectiveness of TC-ALASSO. In addition, experimental results on face recognition databases validate the performance advantage of TC-ALASSO over state-of-the-art methods in dealing with extreme illumination variations.},

In our study, we performed a systematic literature review of noise identification and handling studies published in various conferences and journals between January 1993 to July 2018. We have identified 79 primary studies are of noise identification and noise handling techniques. After investigating these studies, we found that among the noise identification schemes, the accuracy of identification of noisy instances by using ensemble-based techniques are better than other techniques. But regarding efficiency, usually single based techniques method is better; it is more suitable for noisy data sets.

Limited endurance capability demands an optimal guidance algorithm, which will change as the environment does. All optimal path-planning routines are computationally intensive, with processor load a function of the environmental complexity. This paper presents a new algorithm, the reactive route selection algorithm, for storing a bank of optimal trajectories computed off-line and blending between these optimal trajectories as the operating environment changes. An example is presented using a mixed-integer linear program to generate the optimal trajectories.},

NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language.

For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves1 and in the first imaging of a black hole2. Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

As time passes, the search area grows, survival rate decreases, and searchers are faced with an increasingly daunting task of searching large areas in a short amount of time. To optimize the search process, mathematical models of lost person behavior with respect to landscape can be used in conjunction with current SAR practices. In this paper, we introduce an agent-based model of lost person behavior which allows agents to move on known landscapes with behavior defined as independent realizations of a random variable. The behavior random variable selects from a distribution of six known lost person reorientation strategies to simulate the agent's trajectory. We systematically simulate a range of possible behavior distributions and find a best-fit behavioral profile for a hiker with the International Search and Rescue Incident Database. We validate these results with a leave-one-out analysis. This work represents the first time-discrete model of lost person dynamics validated with data from real SAR incidents and has the potential to improve current methods for wilderness SAR.},

Communication is not treated as a constraint but a mission goal. While achieving this goal, our aim is to avoid compromising the area coverage goal and the overall mission time. We define the mission tasks as: search, inform, and monitor at the best possible link quality. Building on our centralized simultaneous inform and connect (SIC) path planning strategy, we propose two adaptive strategies: (1) SIC with QoS (SICQ): optimizes search, inform, and monitor tasks simultaneously and (2) SIC following QoS (SIC+): first optimizes search and inform tasks together and then finds the optimum positions for monitoring. Both strategies utilize information as soon as it becomes available to determine UAV tasks. The strategies can be tuned to prioritize certain tasks in relation to others. We illustrate that more tasks can be performed in the given mission time by efficient incorporation of communication in the path design. We also observe that the quality of the resultant paths improves in terms of connectivity.},

The approach consists of planning separate trajectories in each of the three translational degrees of freedom, and ensuring feasibility by deriving decoupled constraints for each degree of freedom through approximations that preserve feasibility. The presented algorithm can compute a feasible trajectory within tens of microseconds on a laptop computer; remaining computation time can be used to iteratively improve the trajectory. By replanning the trajectory at a high rate, the trajectory generator can be used as an implicit feedback law similar to model predictive control. The solutions generated by the algorithm are analyzed by comparing them with time-optimal motions, and experimental results validate the approach.},

When the environment is unknown, it becomes more challenging as the robot is required to rely on its online map information built during coverage for planning its path. A significant research effort focuses on designing heuristic or approximate algorithms that achieve reasonable performance. Such algorithms have sub-optimal performance in terms of covering the area or the cost of coverage, e.g., coverage time or energy consumption. In this paper, we provide a systematic analysis of the coverage problem and formulate it as an optimal stopping time problem, where the trade-off between coverage performance and its cost is explicitly accounted for. Next, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) techniques can be leveraged to solve the problem computationally. To this end, we provide some technical and practical considerations to facilitate the application of the RL algorithms and improve the efficiency of the solutions. Finally, through experiments in grid world environments and Gazebo simulator, we show that reinforcement learning-based algorithms efficiently cover realistic unknown indoor environments, and outperform the current state of the art.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.}

The importance of accurate and multifaceted monitoring is well known to identify problems early and prevent them escalating. This motivates the need for flexible, autonomous and powerful decision-making mobile robots. These systems need to be able to learn through fusing data from multiple sources. Until very recently, they have been task specific. In this paper, we describe a generic navigation algorithm that uses data from sensors on-board the drone to guide the drone to the site of the problem. In hazardous and safety-critical situations, locating problems accurately and rapidly is vital. We use the proximal policy optimisation deep reinforcement learning algorithm coupled with incremental curriculum learning and long short-term memory neural networks to implement our generic and adaptable navigation algorithm. We evaluate different configurations against a heuristic technique to demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency. Finally, we consider how safety of the drone could be assured by assessing how safely the drone would perform using our navigation algorithm in real-world scenarios.},

Typically, the scaling factor of this action noise is chosen as a hyper-parameter and is kept constant during training. In this paper, we focus on action noise in off-policy deep reinforcement learning for continuous control. We analyze how the learned policy is impacted by the noise type, noise scale, and impact scaling factor reduction schedule. We consider the two most prominent types of action noise, Gaussian and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise, and perform a vast experimental campaign by systematically varying the noise type and scale parameter, and by measuring variables of interest like the expected return of the policy and the state-space coverage during exploration. For the latter, we propose a novel state-space coverage measure \${\textbackslash}operatorname\{X\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{U\}{\textbackslash}text\{rel\}\}\$ that is more robust to estimation artifacts caused by points close to the state-space boundary than previously-proposed measures. Larger noise scales generally increase state-space coverage. However, we found that increasing the space coverage using a larger noise scale is often not beneficial. On the contrary, reducing the noise scale over the training process reduces the variance and generally improves the learning performance. We conclude that the best noise type and scale are environment dependent, and based on our observations derive heuristic rules for guiding the choice of the action noise as a starting point for further optimization.},

The problem aims to determine the search sequence of the subareas and the search mode for each subarea to maximize the probability of finding the target.

  abstract = {In recent years, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many challenging strategy games. Because these games have complicated rules, an action sampled from the full discrete action distribution predicted by the learned policy is likely to be invalid according to the game rules (e.g., walking into a wall). The usual approach to deal with this problem in policy gradient algorithms is to ``mask out'' invalid actions and just sample from the set of valid actions. The implications of this process, however, remain under-investigated. In this paper, we 1) show theoretical justification for such a practice, 2) empirically demonstrate its importance as the space of invalid actions grows, and 3) provide further insights by evaluating different action masking regimes, such as removing masking after an agent has been trained using masking.},

  abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for autonomously acquiring complex behaviors from low-level sensor observations. Although a large portion of deep RL research has focused on applications in video games and simulated control, which does not connect with the constraints of learning in real environments, deep RL has also demonstrated promise in enabling physical robots to learn complex skills in the real world. At the same time, real-world robotics provides an appealing domain for evaluating such algorithms, as it connects directly to how humans learn: as an embodied agent in the real world. Learning to perceive and move in the real world presents numerous challenges, some of which are easier to address than others, and some of which are often not considered in RL research that focuses only on simulated domains. In this review article, we present a number of case studies involving robotic deep RL. Building off of these case studies, we discuss commonly perceived challenges in deep RL and how they have been addressed in these works. We also provide an overview of other outstanding challenges, many of which are unique to the real-world robotics setting and are not often the focus of mainstream RL research. Our goal is to provide a resource both for roboticists and machine learning researchers who are interested in furthering the progress of deep RL in the real world.},

The dynamic model is of high fidelity and nonlinear, with six degrees of freedom that include disturbances and model uncertainties. The control approach is developed based on MPC to track different reference trajectories ranging from simple ones such as circular to complex helical trajectories. In this control technique, a linearized model is derived and the receding horizon method is applied to generate the optimal control sequence. Although MPC is computer expensive, it is highly effective to deal with the different types of nonlinearities and constraints such as actuators' saturation and model uncertainties. The MPC parameters (control and prediction horizons) are selected by trial-and-error approach. Several simulation scenarios are performed to examine and evaluate the performance of the proposed control approach using MATLAB and Simulink environment. Simulation results show that this control approach is highly effective to track a given reference trajectory.},

Since the emergence of Q-learning, many studies have described its uses in reinforcement learning and artificial intelligence problems. However, there is an information gap as to how these powerful algorithms can be leveraged and incorporated into general artificial intelligence workflow. Early Q-learning algorithms were unsatisfactory in several aspects and covered a narrow range of applications. It has also been observed that sometimes, this rather powerful algorithm learns unrealistically and overestimates the action values hence abating the overall performance. Recently with the general advances of machine learning, more variants of Q-learning like Deep Q-learning which combines basic Q learning with deep neural networks have been discovered and applied extensively. In this paper, we thoroughly explain how Q-learning evolved by unraveling the mathematical complexities behind it as well its flow from reinforcement learning family of algorithms. Improved variants are fully described, and we categorize Q-learning algorithms into single-agent and multi-agent approaches. Finally, we thoroughly investigate up-to-date research trends and key applications that leverage Q-learning algorithms.},

As a result, the researchers are continuously improving performance and expanding the applications. However, recent literature reports that the performance of DRL is sensitive to the various design choices, e.g., the neural network initialization. Accordingly, it makes DRL hard to obtain a stable performance, which degrades reproducibility. Therefore, we propose a supervised pre-training method for both policy and value networks to improve stability. We pre-train the policy network to maximize the initial entropy and pre-train the value network to bias the distribution to a specific value. The experiments are conducted on tasks with discrete action space where it is hard to control the initial entropy. Through the experiments, the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of stability and performance is validated.},

How much accessibility bias is present in the vegetation monitoring plots accumulated over the last three decades in Great Smoky Mountains National Park? Location: Great Smoky Mountains National Park, North Carolina and Tennessee, USA. Methods: Distance, slope, stream crossings, and vegetation density were incorporated into a least-cost model of energetic expenditure for human access to locations. Results: Estimated round-trip energy costs for the park ranged from 0 to 1.62 {\texttimes} 105 J kg-1. The estimated round-trip energetic expenditure for the surveys ranged from 53 to 1.51 {\texttimes} 105 J kg-1. Their distribution was more accessible than the random expectation. Ten (17\%) of the vegetation types in the park are significantly under-sampled relative to their area, and 16 (29\%) are over-sampled. Plots in 18 of the 40 vegetation types exhibited a significant positive correlation with accessibility. Conclusions: The least-cost model is an improvement over previous attempts to quantify accessibility. The bias in plot locations suggests using a least-cost model to test for bias in cases in which human accessibility is confounded with other sources of ecosystem variation.},

Our analysis focuses on the Wakeby probability distribution of the crow's flight distance, the parameters of which are known for Alberta in Canada. We compare topographic and ecological characteristics of Alberta with the same features in Poland and argue that -- under a few assumptions -- it is allowed to use the Wakeby probabilistic model for the Canadian region in Polish conditions.

Methods This prospective randomized simulation study was performed in order to compare two different search and rescue techniques in searching for an unconscious victim on snow-covered ground. In the control arm, the Classical Line Search Technique (CLT) was used, in which the search is performed on foot and the victim is reached on foot. In the intervention arm, the Drone-snowmobile Technique (DST) was used, the search being performed by drone and the victim reached by snowmobile. The primary outcome of the study was the comparison of the two search and rescue techniques in terms of first human contact time. Results Twenty search and rescue operations were conducted in this study. Median time to arrival at the mannequin was 57.3min for CLT, compared to 8.9min for DST. The median value of the total searched area was 88,322.0m2 for CLT and 228,613.0m2 for DST. The median area searched per minute was 1489.6m2 for CLT and 32,979.9m2 for DST (p{$<$}0.01 for all comparisons). Conclusions In conclusion, a wider area can be searched faster by drone using DST compared to the classical technique, and the victim can be located faster and reached earlier with rescuers transported by snowmobile.},

However, little effort has been devoted to the formal analysis of the quality of the solution returned by such algorithms, e.g. as a function of the number of samples. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, by rigorously analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the cost of the solution returned by stochastic sampling-based algorithms as the number of samples increases. A number of negative results are provided, characterizing existing algorithms, e.g. showing that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the solution returned by broadly used sampling-based algorithms converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of new algorithms, namely, PRM* and RRT* , which are provably asymptotically optimal, i.e. such that the cost of the returned solution converges almost surely to the optimum. Moreover, it is shown that the computational complexity of the new algorithms is within a constant factor of that of their probabilistically complete (but not asymptotically optimal) counterparts. The analysis in this paper hinges on novel connections between stochastic sampling-based path planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs.},

Their use in wilderness search and rescue (WiSAR), in particular, has been investigated for fast search-area coverage from a high vantage point. The probability of success in such searches, however, can be further improved utilizing cooperative systems that employ both UAVs and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). In this paper, we present a new coordinated-search planning method, for collaborative UAV-UGV teams. The proposed method, particularly developed for WiSAR, considers the search area to be continuously growing and that the search is sparse. It is also assumed that targets detected by UAVs must be identified by a ground-level searcher. The UAV/UGV motion-planning method presented herein, therefore, has two major components: (i) coordinated search and (ii) joint target identification. The novelty of the proposed method lies in its use of (i) time-dependent target-location iso-probability curves, and (ii) an effective and efficient coordinated target-identification algorithm. The method has been validated via numerous simulated WiSAR searches for varying scenarios. Furthermore, extensive comparative experiments with other methods have shown that our method has higher rates of target detection and shorter search times, significantly outperforming alternative techniques by 75\% -- 255\% in terms of target detection probability.},

This paper proposes a hybrid approach to this dynamic problem, where both static and mobile sensors are utilized for the goal of detecting a target. The approach is novel in that a team of robots utilized to deploy a staticsensor network also actively searches for the target via on-board sensors. Synergy is achieved through: 1) optimal deployment planning of static-sensor networks and 2) optimal routing and motion planning of the robots for the deployment of the network and target search. The static-sensor network is planned first to maximize the likelihood of target detection while ensuring (temporal and spatial) unbiasedness in target motion. Robot motions are, subsequently, planned in two stages: 1) route planning and 2) trajectory planning. In the first stage, given a static-sensor network configuration, robot routes are planned to maximize the amount of spare time available to the mobile agents/sensors, for target search in between (just-in-time) static-sensor deployments. In the second stage, given robot routes (i.e., optimal sequences of sensor delivery locations and times), the corresponding robot trajectories are planned to make effective use of any spare time the mobile agents may have to search for the target. The proposed search strategy was validated through extensive simulations, some of which are given in detail here. An analysis of the method's performance in terms of target-search success is also included.},

Maximizing the effectiveness of an autonomous multi-UAV search team, however, requires optimal task allocation between the team members, as well as the planning of the individual flight trajectories. This paper addresses this constrained resource-allocation optimization problem via the use of iso-probability curves that represent probabilistic target-location information in a search region growing with time. The optimization metric used is the allocation of the search effort proportional to the target location likelihood. The proposed method also avoids redundancy in coverage while planning the UAV trajectories. Numerous simulated search experiments, two of which are detail herein, were carried out to demonstrate our method's effectiveness in wilderness search and rescue (WiSAR) planning using a multi-UAV team.

  abstract = {The search for a mobile target is a dynamic spatial and temporal problem. Information gathered during the search, regarding the potential whereabouts of the target, can be used to influence significantly the search strategy employed. In this paper, thus, a novel (wireless) static-sensor network deployment strategy is presented to detect efficiently and effectively a mobile target in an unbounded environment. The proposed strategy deploys the static sensors optimally and in a time-phased manner while adapting in real-time to the availability of new information during the search. An optimal network-deployment plan, herein, refers to a set of optimal sensor-deployment times and locations. The optimal sensor-deployment instances aim to achieve a uniform deployment of search effort over time. Optimal sensor-deployment locations, in turn, are determined according to the highest possible likelihood of detection of the mobile target. The proposed deployment strategy contains two novel contributions: it makes use of a non-parametric approach to estimate effectively the target location likelihood, and it performs an optimization of sensor-placement times to maximize the adaptive characteristic of the deployment plan. Several detailed experiments (in virtual and physical environments) of the proposed strategy for static-sensor network deployment in wilderness search and rescue applications are presented. Furthermore, a comparative study is included to highlight the advantages of our approach versus traditional methods that deploy sensors simultaneously for uniform coverage.},

  abstract = {In this study, we present a novel hybrid algorithm, combining Levy Flight (LF) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) (LF-PSO), tailored for efficient multi-robot exploration in unknown environments with limited communication and no global positioning information. The research addresses the growing interest in employing multiple autonomous robots for exploration tasks, particularly in scenarios such as Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) operations. Multiple robots offer advantages like increased task coverage, robustness, flexibility, and scalability. However, existing approaches often make assumptions such as search area, robot positioning, communication restrictions, and target information that may not hold in real-world situations. The hybrid algorithm leverages LF, known for its effectiveness in large space exploration with sparse targets, and incorporates inter-robot repulsion as a social component through PSO. This combination enhances area exploration efficiency. We redefine the local best and global best positions to suit scenarios without continuous target information. Experimental simulations in a controlled environment demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness, showcasing improved area coverage compared to traditional methods. In the process of refining our approach and testing it in complex, obstacle-rich environments, the presented work holds promise for enhancing multi-robot exploration in scenarios with limited information and communication capabilities.},

It has the potential to replace overly conservative or inefficient navigation approaches. However, the integration of Deep Reinforcement Learning into existing navigation systems is still an open frontier due to the myopic nature of Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-based navigation, which hinders its widespread integration into current navigation systems. In this paper, we propose the concept of an intermediate planner to interconnect novel Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-based obstacle avoidance with conventional global planning methods using waypoint generation. Therefore, we integrate different waypoint generators into existing navigation systems and compare the joint system against traditional ones. We found an increased performance in terms of safety, efficiency and path smoothness especially in highly dynamic environments.},

  abstract = {Navigation of mobile robots within crowded environments is an essential task in various use cases, such as delivery, health care, or logistics. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) emerged as an alternative method to replace overly conservative approaches and promises more efficient and flexible navigation. However, Deep Reinforcement Learning is limited to local navigation due to its myopic nature. Previous research works proposed various ways to combine Deep Reinforcement Learning with conventional methods but a common problem is the complexity of highly dynamic environments due to the unpredictability of humans and other objects within the environment. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical waypoint generator, which considers moving obstacles and thus generates safer and more robust waypoints for Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-based local planners. Therefore, we utilize Delaunay Triangulation to encode obstacles and incorporate an extended hybrid A-Star approach to efficiently search for an optimal solution in the time-state space. We compared our waypoint generator against two baseline approaches and outperform them in terms of safety, efficiency, and robustness.},

Each pilot sees the environment from the perspective of their drone by means of video streamed from an onboard camera. Reaching the level of professional pilots with an autonomous drone is challenging because the robot needs to fly at its physical limits while estimating its speed and location in the circuit exclusively from onboard sensors1. Here we introduce Swift, an autonomous system that can race physical vehicles at the level of the human world champions. The system combines deep reinforcement learning (RL) in simulation with data collected in the physical world. Swift competed against three human champions, including the world champions of two international leagues, in real-world head-to-head races. Swift won several races against each of the human champions and demonstrated the fastest recorded race time. This work represents a milestone for mobile robotics and machine intelligence2, which may inspire the deployment of hybrid learning-based solutions in other physical systems.},

To model this variation for runners, we analyse record times for 91 uphill and 15 downhill races or race stages. The pace is modelled as a nonlinear function of gradient and a linear function of race duration, using ordinary least squares to obtain a best fit. For the gradient-dependence, six functional forms are compared, of which a quartic is found to fit the data best; however, at steep gradients the quartic model is unrealistic and it may be argued that a linear model is more appropriate. Critical gradients, at which a runner's vertical speed (uphill or downhill) is maximised, may be calculated from a nonlinear model, although it appears that there is no uphill critical gradient within the range of our dataset. {\copyright} 2012 American Statistical Association.},

Various factors, including elevation, slope angle, slope aspect, flow accumulation, flow direction, topographic wetness index (TWI), drainage density, rainfall, and normalized difference vegetation index, were generated using a digital elevation model and LANDSAT 8 imagery. Historical flood data from 2015 to 2019, including 307 flood events, were adopted for a comparison of flood susceptibility. Using these factors, the GANN model, based on the back-propagation neural network (BPNN), was employed to provide flood susceptibility. The validation results indicate that a satisfactory result, with a correlation coefficient of 0.814, was obtained. A comparison of the GANN model with those from the SOBEK model was conducted. The comparative results demonstrated that the proposed method can provide good accuracy in predicting flood susceptibility. The results of flood susceptibility are categorized into five classes: Very low, low, moderate, high, and very high, with coverage areas of 60.5\%, 27.4\%, 8.6\%, 2.5\%, and 1\%, respectively. The results demonstrate that nearly 3.5\% of the study area, including the core district of the city and an exceedingly populated area including the financial center of the city, can be categorized as high to very high flood susceptibility zones.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator.

  abstract = {Prospective control of walking and running requires perceiving sloping surfaces that can and cannot support these activities. Two experiments on slant perception were conducted, motivated by the notion of geographical slant rather than optical slant, and by an affordance based description of surface layout. In Experiment 1, participants standing on a horizontal surface (the ground) adjusted the inclination in the frontal plane of a large wooden platform at 0, 2, or 4 m from them until satisfied that it was at the maximal slope at which ordinary walking could be conducted. Subsequent to their judgments, the actual maximum of a "walk-onable" slope was determined for each participant. In Experiment 2, participants adjusted the inclination of the visible platform to match the inclination of the right foot, which was occluded and resting against a small ramp inclined between 0{$^\circ$} and 50{$^\circ$} to the ground plane. They then judged the visible platform for its walk-inability and were subsequently tested for the maximal slope that each could in fact walk on in the ordinary manner. In both experiments, perception of the maximal slope that is walk-on-able conformed closely to the actual slope maximum permitting ordinary walking. The discussion of the results addresses limitations of previous slant perception research and underscores the importance of action relevant measures to investigations of the perception of surface layout.}

  abstract = {Abstract : For the first time in history, a scientifically sound yet practical method for objectively determining detection probabilities for objects of importance to search and rescue (SAR) in the land environment was successfully developed and field-tested. Data was collected using volunteer searchers and analyzed with simplified analysis techniques, all at very low cost. This work opens the door for resolving search planning and evaluation issues that have been vigorously debated within the land SAR community for nearly 30 years but never settled. Searching is by its very nature a probabilistic process. However, a carefully planned search using the right tools and concepts is significantly more likely to succeed and, of equal importance when lives are at stake, succeed sooner. Planning a search consists of evaluating all the available information and then, since it is not generally possible to do a thorough search everywhere all at once, deciding how to best utilize the available, and often limited, search resources. However, a carefully planned search using the right tools and concepts is significantly more likely to succeed and, of equal importance when lives are at stake, succeed sooner. The simplest metric for quantifying \&quot;detectability\&quot; is a value called the \&quot;effective sweep (or search) width\&quot; (ESW). This concept reduces the combined effects of all the factors affecting detection (sensor, environment, search object) in a given search situation to a single number characterizing search object \&quot;detectability\&quot; for that situation. Effective Sweep Width can be considered a \&quot;detectability index\&quot; that takes everything into consideration. An experimental methodology to determine effective sweep width had already been piloted and discussed in A Method for Determining Effective Sweep Widths For Land Searches: Procedures for Conducting Detection Experiments. That report made several suggestions for enhancements and noted several difficulties that occurred during the pilot experime},

We show that the chosen simulation environments benefit the most from single core performance.

We characterize this loss of expressivity via a drop in the rank of the learned value network features, and show that this typically corresponds to a performance drop. We demonstrate this phenomenon on Atari and Gym benchmarks, in both offline and online RL settings. We formally analyze this phenomenon and show that it results from a pathological interaction between bootstrapping and gradient-based optimization.

Given a searching region where some information about the target is known but uncertain (i.e. location and dynamics), and a searching agent with constrained dynamics, we provide two decision making algorithms that optimizes the agent actions to find the target in a minimum time. The problem is faced as a discrete optimization: the actions and the sensor are discrete, and the target probabilistic model is described over a graph, where each vertex contains the target's location probability information and each edge defines the agent possible actions. We revisit the mathematical model of the optimal search problem and we propose a novel approach to include the time into the decision making by reinterpreting it as a maximum discounted time reward problem. The optimal decision plan for the agent is obtained by solving this non convex discrete problem using the cross entropy method. By performing statistical simulations we show how the target is found in minimum time.}

A real-time receding horizon controller in continuous action space is developed based on a decentralized gradient-based optimization algorithm and by using the expected observation as an estimate of future rewards. The expected observation is a cost-to-go heuristic that estimates the goodness of the states that the platforms could reach. It permits the decision making algorithm to take into account the information on the whole environment, reducing the time needed to detect the target. The heuristic, modeled as a sensor, allows us to develop a new team utility function with low computational cost and high performance. It can be applied to challenging scenarios such as multi-target search with complex and non-uniform target probability distributions. Through simulation and statistical analysis, we show the advantages of using the expected observation heuristic in multi-vehicle coordination for search applications.},

  abstract = {Autonomous trajectory generation in a complex environment is a challenging task for multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which have high maneuverability in three-dimensional motion. Safe and effective operations for these UAVs demand obstacle avoidance strategies and advanced trajectory planning and control schemes for stability and energy efficiency. To solve those problems in one framework analytically is extremely challenging when the UAV needs to fly large distance in a complex environment. To address this challenge, a two-level optimization strategy is adopted. At the higher-level, a sequence of waypoints is selected that lead the UAV from its current position to the destination. At the lower-level, an optimal trajectory is generated between each pair of adjacent waypoints analytically. While the goal of trajectory generation is to maintain the stability of the UAV, the goal of the waypoints planning is to select waypoints with the lowest control thrust consumption throughout the entire trip while avoiding collisions with obstacles. The entire framework is implemented using deep reinforcement learning, which learns the highly complicated and non-linear interaction between those two levels, and the impact from the environment. A progressive learning strategy is investigated that not only reduces convergence time but also improves result quality. We further investigate and provide results regarding the tuning of gains in the optimal trajectory scheme using genetic algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach is able to generate a list of obstacle-free waypoints with minimum control energy and develop an optimal trajectory with optimized platform velocity, acceleration, jerk and control thrust.},

We introduce a novel algorithm, Hyperband, for this framework and analyze its theoretical properties, providing several desirable guarantees. Furthermore, we compare Hyperband with popular Bayesian optimization methods on a suite of hyperparameter optimization problems.

On the basis of obstacle repulsion, the repulsion force between UAV is increased, and the pre-centroid of the cluster is defined as another source of gravity. The analysis of the algorithm shows that this method can effectively prevent the UAV from falling into the local minimum and enhance the control and obstacle avoidance ability of the UAV cluster. Based on the UAV control model, the path planning design is given and the simulation experiment is carried out.

  abstract = {Soft-argmax operation is commonly adopted in detection-based methods to localize the target position in a differentiable manner. However, training the neural network with soft-argmax makes the shape of the probability map unconstrained. Consequently, the model lacks pixel-wise supervision through the map during training, leading to performance degradation. In this work, we propose sampling-argmax, a differentiable training method that imposes implicit constraints to the shape of the probability map by minimizing the expectation of the localization error. To approximate the expectation, we introduce a continuous formulation of the output distribution and develop a differentiable sampling process. The expectation can be approximated by calculating the average error of all samples drawn from the output distribution. We show that sampling-argmax can seamlessly replace the conventional soft-argmax operation on various localization tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed method. Code is available at https://github.com/Jeff-sjtu/sampling-argmax},

  abstract = {With the increasing of risk potential in crowded places, evacuation management becomes practically important to ensure the safety of crowds. The studies of crowd evacuation in normal or emergency situations have become a hot topic. Due to the distinct advantages of high efficiency, strong scalability and simple implementation, cellular automata models (CA) have become one of the most widely-used models for evacuation. However, the practical requirements of evacuation propose some important challenges for CA models, for example, to accurately characterize both position and velocity of individuals, to depict environments and accidents, and to describe human behaviors. In the last 20 years, there are many studies aiming at resolving the above challenges. Starting from the challenges mentioned above, this paper tries to give a review of CA models, specially used for crowd evacuation. Firstly, we give an overview of CA models for evacuation, and put forward research paradigm, modeling framework and classification of CA models. The models used for evacuation are classified into three kinds of categories, i.e. lattice gas model, floor field model, and other field-based models. The last category includes potential field model, electrostatic-induced potential field model, cost potential field model, etc. Then, three main challenges of CA models for evacuation are presented, and the improvements for each type of challenge are summarized. Typical simulation scenarios and research issues are further proposed. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of CA models are illustrated from the aspects of implementation, performance, scalability, accuracy and applicability.},

After revisiting RNN-based methods for trajectory modeling, we expose two common critical drawbacks in the existing uses. First, RNNs are discrete-time models that only update the hidden states upon the arrival of new observations, which makes them an awkward fit for learning real-world trajectories with continuous-time dynamics. Second, real-world trajectories are never perfectly accurate due to unexpected sensor noise. Most RNN-based approaches are deterministic and thereby vulnerable to such noise. To tackle these challenges, we devise a novel method entitled TrajODE for more natural modeling of trajectories. It combines the continuous-time characteristic of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) with the robustness of stochastic latent spaces. Extensive experiments on the task of trajectory classification demonstrate the superiority of our framework against the RNN counterparts.},

  abstract = {In Wilderness Search and Rescue (WiSAR), the incident commander (IC) creates a probability distribution map of the likely location of the missing person. This map is important because it guides the IC in allocating search resources and coordinating efforts, but it often depends almost exclusively on the missing person profile, prior experience, and subjective judgment. We propose a Bayesian model that uses publicly available terrain features data to help model lost-person behaviors. This approach enables domain experts to encode uncertainty in their prior estimations and also makes it possible to incorporate human behavior data collected in the form of posterior distributions, which are used to build a first-order Markov transition matrix for generating a temporal, posterior predictive probability distribution map. The map can work as a base to be augmented by search and rescue workers to incorporate additional information. Using a Bayesian {$\chi$}2 test for goodness-of-fit, we show that the model fits a synthetic dataset well. This model also serves as a foundation for a larger framework that allows for easy expansion to incorporate additional factors such as season and weather conditions that affect the lost-person's behaviors.},

The success of RL relies on two human-designed heuristics: appropriate action space definition and reward function engineering. The commonly used fully continuous or fully discrete action spaces in optimal control and decision making problems may lack control authority and remove the inherent problem structure, which can negatively affect learning performance. Besides, reward engineering requires a lot of human effort and may lead to unwanted behavior. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a new off-policy RL algorithm called HER-PDQN which incorporates Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) with Parameterized Deep Q-Networks (P-DQN). In simulation experiments, HER-PDQN is used to train an agent to fulfill a UAV navigation task in a 2-dimensional environment. The results indicate the effectiveness of P-DQN algorithm in dealing both with the hybrid action space and sparse rewards. This paper can be considered as the first attempt at applying RL in sparse reward setting for UAV navigation with hybrid action spaces.}

The problem of joint non-convex three-dimensional (3D) deployment and dynamic movement of the UAVs is formulated for maximizing the sum mean opinion score (MOS) of ground users, which is proved to be NP-hard. In the aim of solving this pertinent problem, a three-step approach is proposed for attaining 3D deployment and dynamic movement of multiple UAVs. Firstly, a genetic algorithm based K-means (GAK-means) algorithm is utilized for obtaining the cell partition of the users. Secondly, Q-learning based deployment algorithm is proposed, in which each UAV acts as an agent, making their own decision for attaining 3D position by learning from trial and mistake. In contrast to the conventional genetic algorithm based learning algorithms, the proposed algorithm is capable of training the direction selection strategy offline. Thirdly, Q-learning based movement algorithm is proposed in the scenario that the users are roaming. The proposed algorithm is capable of converging to an optimal state. Numerical results reveal that the proposed algorithms show a fast convergence rate after a small number of iterations. Additionally, the proposed Q-learning based deployment algorithm outperforms K-means algorithms and Iterative-GAKmean (IGK) algorithms with low complexity.},

In traditional SAR, fixed search path planning is inefficient and cannot prioritize high-probability regions, which has significant limitations. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) path planning for maritime SAR based on POS-DQN so that USVs can perform SAR tasks reasonably and efficiently. Firstly, the search region is allocated as a whole using an improved task allocation algorithm so that the task region of each USV has priority and no duplication. Secondly, this paper considers the probability of success (POS) of the search environment and proposes a POS-DQN algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning. This algorithm can adapt to the complex and changing environment of SAR. It designs a probability weight reward function and trains USV agents to obtain the optimal search path. Finally, based on the simulation results, by considering the complete coverage of obstacle avoidance and collision avoidance, the search path using this algorithm can prioritize high-probability regions and improve the efficiency of SAR.},

The fundamental principle of maintaining the optimal deployment of the robots throughout the search guides the MRC methodology.

One fundamental step is to encode a single point location into an embedding space, such that this embedding is learning-friendly for downstream machine learning models such as support vector machines and neural networks. We call this process location encoding. However, there lacks a systematic review on the concept of location encoding, its potential applications, and key challenges that need to be addressed. This paper aims to fill this gap. We first provide a formal definition of location encoding, and discuss the necessity of location encoding for GeoAI research from a machine learning perspective. Next, we provide a comprehensive survey and discussion about the current landscape of location encoding research. We classify location encoding models into different categories based on their inputs and encoding methods, and compare them based on whether they are parametric, multi-scale, distance preserving, and direction aware. We demonstrate that existing location encoding models can be unified under a shared formulation framework. We also discuss the application of location encoding for different types of spatial data. Finally, we point out several challenges in location encoding research that need to be solved in the future.},

We dispel such beliefs by introducing a random search method for training static, linear policies for continuous control problems, matching state-of-the-art sample efficiency on the benchmark MuJoCo locomotion tasks. Our method also finds a nearly optimal controller for a challenging instance of the Linear Quadratic Regulator, a classical problem in control theory, when the dynamics are not known. Computationally, our random search algorithm is at least 15 times more efficient than the fastest competing model-free methods on these benchmarks. We take advantage of this computational efficiency to evaluate the performance of our method over hundreds of random seeds and many different hyperparameter configurations for each benchmark task. Our simulations highlight a high variability in performance in these benchmark tasks, suggesting that commonly used estimations of sample efficiency do not adequately evaluate the performance of RL algorithms.},

Grouping patients into distinct subsets, for example, via clustering, may enable the discovery of unknown disease patterns or comorbidities, which could eventually lead to better treatment through personalized medicine. Patient data derived from EHRs is heterogeneous and temporally irregular. Therefore, traditional machine learning methods like PCA are ill-suited for analysis of EHR-derived patient data. We propose to address these issues with a new methodology based on training a gated recurrent unit (GRU) autoencoder directly on health record data. Our method learns a low-dimensional feature space by training on patient data time series, where the time of each data point is expressed explicitly. We use positional encodings for time, allowing our model to better handle the temporal irregularity of the data. We apply our method to data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III). Using our data-derived feature space, we can cluster patients into groups representing major classes of disease patterns. Additionally, we show that our feature space exhibits a rich substructure at multiple scales.},

  abstract = {Quadrotor UAVs have successfully been used both in research and for commercial applications in recent years and there has been significant progress in the design of robust control software and hardware. Nevertheless, testing of prototype UAV systems still means risk of damage due to failures. Motivated by this, a system for the comprehensive simulation of quadrotor UAVs is presented in this paper. Unlike existing solutions, the presented system is integrated with ROS and the Gazebo simulator. This comprehensive approach allows simultaneous simulation of diverse aspects such as flight dynamics, onboard sensors like IMUs, external imaging sensors and complex environments. The dynamics model of the quadrotor has been parameterized using wind tunnel tests and validated by a comparison of simulated and real flight data. The applicability for simulation of complex UAV systems is demonstrated using LIDAR-based and visual SLAM approaches available as open source software.},

We show that the nominal ARVA measurement can be linearly related to a quantity that is sufficient to reconstruct the victim position. We explicitly deal with a robust scenario in which the measurement is actually perturbed by the noise that grows with the distance to the victim and propose an adaptive control scheme based on a least-square identifier and a trajectory generator whose role is both to guarantee the persistence of excitation for the identifier and to steer the ARVA receiver toward the victim. We prove that the controller ensures boundedness of trajectories and enables to localize the victim in a domain where the ARVA output is sufficiently informative. We illustrate its performance in a realistic simulation framework specifically developed with real data. The proposed approach could significantly reduce the searching time by providing an exploitable estimate before having reached the victim.},

The population evolves for many generations; when the algorithm finishes the best solution is returned. Genetic algorithms are particularly useful for problems where it is extremely difficult or impossible to get an exact solution, or for difficult problems where an exact solution may not be required.

In particular, we have chosen the commonlyused NSGA-II algorithm for this purpose. The algorithm generates a curved path which is represented using B-Spline curves. The control points of the B-Spline curve are the decision variables in the genetic algorithm. In particular, we solve two problems, assuming the normal flight envelope restriction: i) Path planning for UAV when no other constraint is assumed to be present and ii) Path planning for UAV if the vehicle has to necessarily pass through a particular point in the space. The use of a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm helps in generating a number of feasible paths with different trade-offs between the objective functions. The availability of a number of trade-off solutions allows the user to choose a path according to his/her needs easily, thereby making the approach more pragmatic. Although an automated decision-making aid is the next immediate need of research, we defer it for another study.},

The performance is analyzed by simulating the walking task of a quadruped equipped with a range of sensors present on a physical quadruped robot. Simulations of the three algorithms across a range of sensor inputs and with domain randomization are performed. The strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm for the given task are discussed. We also identify a set of sensors that contribute to the best performance of each Deep Reinforcement algorithm.},

Likewise, ecological level researches on TB incidence rate at the national level are inadequate for epidemiologic inferences. We collected 278 exploratory variables including environmental and a broad range of socio-economic features for modeling the disease across the continental US. The spatial pattern of the disease distribution was statistically evaluated using the global Moran's I, Getis--Ord General G, and local Gi* statistics. Next, we investigated the applicability of multilayer perceptron (MLP) ANN for predicting the disease incidence. To avoid overfitting, L1 regularization was used before developing the models. Predictive performance of the MLP was compared with linear regression for test dataset using root mean square error, mean absolute error, and correlations between model output and ground truth. Results of clustering analysis showed that there is a significant spatial clustering of smoothed TB incidence rate (p {$<$} 0.05) and the hotspots were mainly located in the southern and southeastern parts of the country. Among the developed models, single hidden layer MLP had the best test accuracy. Sensitivity analysis of the MLP model showed that immigrant population (proportion), underserved segments of the population, and minimum temperature were among the factors with the strongest contributions. The findings of this study can provide useful insight to health authorities on prioritizing resource allocation to risk-prone areas.},

  abstract = {Tracked mobile robots (TMRs) can be considered as the most important type of mobile robots. Large contact area of tracks with the ground provides superior advantages for TMRs such as better mobility in unstructured environments, though it may cause a higher risk of slippage. In this paper, an experimental slip model is proposed for exact kinematics modeling, and the parameters of this model will be determined based on experimental analysis of ResQuake. This is a tele-operative rescue mobile robot with great capabilities in climbing obstacles in destructed areas, and its performance was demonstrated in Rescue robot league of RoboCup 2005 in Osaka (Japan), achieving the 2nd best design award, and RoboCup 2006 in Bremen (Germany) achieving the best operator interface award. Therefore, ResQuake is used here as an experimental platform to study the relationship between slippage of tracks and two main physically meaningful factors, i.e. radius of the tracking path and speed of the robot. The slip coefficients will be obtained as an exponential function of radius of curvature of the path. To validate the obtained results, the proposed model will be used along with two path tracking controllers, and it is empirically demonstrated that the developed model drastically improves the system performance in terms of lower path tracking errors.}

Maximizing the objective adequately, i.e., quickly enough and with sufficient realism, can have substantial positive impact in terms of human lives saved. In this paper, we address the problem of efficiently optimizing search paths in the context of the NP-hard optimal search path problem with visibility, based on search theory. To that end, we evaluate and develop ant colony optimization algorithm variants where the goal is to maximize the probability of finding a moving search object with Markovian motion, given a finite time horizon and finite resources (scans) to allocate to visible regions. Our empirical results, based on evaluating 96 variants of the metaheuristic with standard components tailored to the problem and using realistic size search environments, provide valuable insights regarding the best algorithm configurations. Furthermore, our best variants compare favorably, especially on the larger and more realistic instances, with a standard greedy heuristic and a state-of-the-art mixed-integer linear program solver. With this research, we add to the empirical body of evidence on an ant colony optimization algorithms configuration and applications, and pave the way to the implementation of search path optimization in operational decision support systems for search and rescue.},

  abstract = {For autonomous quadrotors to be used for applications such as delivery, disaster response, and inspection, there is a need to fly near obstacles, especially in urban and indoor environments. Often, it is also beneficial to fly at high speeds to complete tasks quickly. A key challenge in enabling these capabilities is to plan trajectories, in a limited time period, that are safe, collision-free, and dynamically feasible. In this context, dynamic feasibility means that the trajectory can be accurately tracked in flight: a critical requirement when flying near to obstacles. When evaluating trajectory planning algorithms, it is important to understand their strengths and weaknesses; in this paper, we compare three state-of-the-art algorithms with a set of real-world planning scenarios and assessments of performance when planned trajectories are tracked in flight. We introduce a combination of the work of Campos-Macias et al. with Bry et al., which is shown to perform well for slow and conservative trajectories. The algorithm from Bry et al. is shown to perform the best for higher speed trajectories with relatively large amounts of open space. An adaptation of the algorithm from the work of Chamitoff et al. for quadrotor applications, as presented here, is shown to be the best planner for high-speed trajectories in tight confines, while relaxing the need for initial seed-paths that are collision free.},

Despite many advances over the past three decades, learning in many domains still requires a large amount of interaction with the environment, which can be prohibitively expensive in realistic scenarios. To address this problem, transfer learning has been applied to reinforcement learning such that experience gained in one task can be leveraged when starting to learn the next, harder task. More recently, several lines of research have explored how tasks, or data samples themselves, can be sequenced into a curriculum for the purpose of learning a problem that may otherwise be too difficult to learn from scratch. In this article, we present a framework for curriculum learning (CL) in reinforcement learning, and use it to survey and classify existing CL methods in terms of their assumptions, capabilities, and goals. Finally, we use our framework to find open problems and suggest directions for future RL curriculum learning research.},

Therefore, effectively dealing with noise is a key aspect in supervised learning to obtain reliable models from data. Although several authors have studied the effect of noise for some particular learners, comparisons of its effect among different learners are lacking. In this paper, we address this issue by systematically comparing how different degrees of noise affect four supervised learners that belong to different paradigms. Specifically, we consider the Na{\"i}ve Bayes probabilistic classifier, the C4.5 decision tree, the IBk instance-based learner and the SMO support vector machine. We have selected four methods which enable us to contrast different learning paradigms, and which are considered to be four of the top ten algorithms in data mining (Yu et~al. 2007). We test them on a collection of data sets that are perturbed with noise in the input attributes and noise in the output class. As an initial hypothesis, we assign the techniques to two groups, NB with C4.5 and IBk with SMO, based on their proposed sensitivity to noise, the first group being the least sensitive. The analysis enables us to extract key observations about the effect of different types and degrees of noise on these learning techniques. In general, we find that Na{\"i}ve Bayes appears as the most robust algorithm, and SMO the least, relative to the other two techniques. However, we find that the underlying empirical behavior of the techniques is more complex, and varies depending on the noise type and the specific data set being processed. In general, noise in the training data set is found to give the most difficulty to the learners.},

The experiment took place on March 2--3, 2017, at two sites located in southwestern Poland. Three groups acted in the experiment: (1) SARUAV and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operators, (2) ground searchers, and (3) participants who simulated being lost. In the uncomplicated topography without snow cover, the system identified the lost persons, and ground searchers found them 31 min after the SARUAV report had been disseminated. In the mountainous area covered with snow, one person was found within 9 min after searchers received the SARUAV report; however, the other two persons were not identified by SARUAV. The field experiment served as a proof of concept of the SARUAV system, confirmed its potential in person identification studies, and helped to identify numerous scientific and technical problems that need to be solved to develop a mature version of the system.},

  abstract = {An evolutionary algorithm based framework, a combination of modified breeder genetic algorithms incorporating characteristics of classic genetic algorithms, is utilized to design an offline/online path planner for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) autonomous navigation. The path planner calculates a curved path line with desired characteristics in a three-dimensional (3-D) rough terrain environment, represented using B-spline curves, with the coordinates of its control points being the evolutionary algorithm artificial chromosome genes. Given a 3-D rough environment and assuming flight envelope restrictions, two problems are solved: i) UAV navigation using an offline planner in a known environment, and, ii) UAV navigation using an online planner in a completely unknown environment. The offline planner produces a single B-Spline curve that connects the starting and target points with a predefined initial direction. The online planner, based on the offline one, is given on-board radar readings which gradually produces a smooth 3-D trajectory aiming at reaching a predetermined target in an unknown environment; the produced trajectory consists of smaller B-spline curves smoothly connected with each other. Both planners have been tested under different scenarios, and they have been proven effective in guiding an UAV to its final destination, providing near-optimal curved paths quickly and efficiently.},

Due to the unpredictable nature of these environments, deep learning techniques can be used to perform these tasks. In this paper, we present the first use of deep learning to address the robot exploration task in USAR applications. In particular, we uniquely combine the traditional approach of frontier-based exploration with deep reinforcement learning to allow a robot to autonomously explore unknown cluttered environments. Experiments conducted with a mobile robot in unknown cluttered environments of varying sizes and layouts showed that the proposed exploration approach can effectively determine appropriate frontier locations to navigate to while being robust to different environment layouts and sizes. Furthermore, a comparison study with other frontier exploration approaches showed that our learning-based frontier exploration technique was able to explore more of an environment earlier on, allowing for potential identification of a larger number of victims at the beginning of the time-critical exploration task.},

  abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have recently achieved remarkable successes in various sequential decision making tasks, leveraging advances in methods for training large deep networks. However, these methods usually require large amounts of training data, which is often a big problem for real-world applications. One natural question to ask is whether learning good representations for states and using larger networks helps in learning better policies. In this paper, we try to study if increasing input dimensionality helps improve performance and sample efficiency of model-free deep RL algorithms. To do so, we propose an online feature extractor network (OFENet) that uses neural nets to produce good representations to be used as inputs to deep RL algorithms. Even though the high dimensionality of input is usually supposed to make learning of RL agents more difficult, we show that the RL agents in fact learn more efficiently with the high-dimensional representation than with the lower-dimensional state observations. We believe that stronger feature propagation together with larger networks (and thus larger search space) allows RL agents to learn more complex functions of states and thus improves the sample efficiency. Through numerical experiments, we show that the proposed method outperforms several other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both sample efficiency and performance. Codes for the proposed method are available at http://www.merl.com/research/license/OFENet.},

  abstract = {The success of deep learning in the computer vision and natural language processing communities can be attributed to training of very deep neural networks with millions or billions of parameters which can then be trained with massive amounts of data. However, similar trend has largely eluded training of deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms where larger networks do not lead to performance improvement. Previous work has shown that this is mostly due to instability during training of deep RL agents when using larger networks. In this paper, we make an attempt to understand and address training of larger networks for deep RL. We first show that naively increasing network capacity does not improve performance. Then, we propose a novel method that consists of 1) wider networks with DenseNet connection, 2) decoupling representation learning from training of RL, 3) a distributed training method to mitigate overfitting problems. Using this three-fold technique, we show that we can train very large networks that result in significant performance gains. We present several ablation studies to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method and some intuitive understanding of the reasons for performance gain. We show that our proposed method outperforms other baseline algorithms on several challenging locomotion tasks.},

The objective is to develop a path planning algorithm in order to maximize area coverage and minimise coverage time. Each region of the search area is weighted with respect to other regions of the search area. The weight of a region indicates the uncertainty within the region. Regions with a higher weighting are more important or have a higher uncertainty and hence the vehicle should concentrate more on those regions than on regions with lower weightings. The weights on regions are represented by differences in uncertainty. An uncertainty is assigned to each region. The definition of coverage is introduced as the summation of uncertainty. The goal of the planner is to maximize coverage and to minimise time while satisfying the constraints on the vehicle, such as velocity and turning radius constraints. The planner generates a modified lawn-mower search pattern to achieve the objectives resulting in more than 96\% coverage, on average, and reduced search distances by as much as 38\% compared to the typical lawn-mower pattern. {\copyright} 2007 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Robotic simulators are crucial for academic research and education as well as the development of safety-critical applications. Reinforcement learning environments -- simple simulations coupled with a problem specification in the form of a reward function -- are also important to standardize the development (and benchmarking) of learning algorithms. Yet, full-scale simulators typically lack portability and parallelizability. Vice versa, many reinforcement learning environments trade-off realism for high sample throughputs in toy-like problems. While public data sets have greatly benefited deep learning and computer vision, we still lack the software tools to simultaneously develop -- and fairly compare -- control theory and reinforcement learning approaches. In this paper, we propose an open-source OpenAI Gym-like environment for multiple quadcopters based on the Bullet physics engine. Its multi-agent and vision based reinforcement learning interfaces, as well as the support of realistic collisions and aerodynamic effects, make it, to the best of our knowledge, a first of its kind. We demonstrate its use through several examples, either for control (trajectory tracking with PID control, multi-robot flight with downwash, etc.) or reinforcement learning (single and multi-agent stabilization tasks), hoping to inspire future research that combines control theory and machine learning.},

The task that the agent has to learn can either be to maximize its performance over (i) that fixed period, or (ii) an indefinite period where time limits are only used during training to diversify experience. In this paper, we provide a formal account for how time limits could effectively be handled in each of the two cases and explain why not doing so can cause state aliasing and invalidation of experience replay, leading to suboptimal policies and training instability. In case (i), we argue that the terminations due to time limits are in fact part of the environment, and thus a notion of the remaining time should be included as part of the agent's input to avoid violation of the Markov property. In case (ii), the time limits are not part of the environment and are only used to facilitate learning. We argue that this insight should be incorporated by bootstrapping from the value of the state at the end of each partial episode. For both cases, we illustrate empirically the significance of our considerations in improving the performance and stability of existing reinforcement learning algorithms, showing state-of-the-art results on several control tasks.},

  abstract = {Autonomous exploration is an essential task for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in unknown environments. Often, UAVs on these missions must first build a map of the environment via pure exploration and subsequently use (i.e. exploit) the generated map for downstream navigation tasks. Accomplishing these navigation tasks in two separate steps is not always possible and can potentially be disadvantageous for UAVs deployed in outdoor and dynamically changing environments. Current exploration approaches typically use a priori human-generated maps or heuristics such as frontier-based exploration. Other approaches use learning but focus only on learning policies for specific tasks and use sample inefficient random exploration or make impractical assumptions about full map availability. In this paper, we develop an adaptive exploration approach that allows for a trade off between exploration and exploitation in a single step using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). We specifically focus on UAVs searching for areas of interest (AoIs) in an unknown environment. The proposed approach uses a map segmentation technique to decompose the environment map into smaller, tractable maps. DDQN and A2C algorithms are extended with a stack of LSTM layers and trained to generate optimal policies for the exploration and exploitation tasks, respectively. Then, an information gain function is repeatedly computed to determine the optimal trade-off between them. We tested our approach in 3 different tasks against 4 baselines. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach is capable of navigating through randomly generated environments and covering more AoI in less time compared to the baselines.}

  abstract = {Wilderness Search and Rescue (WiSAR) requires navigating large regions - often in rugged, remote areas - searching for missing people or animals. Because of the large regions and potentially limited mobility of ground vehicles, WiSAR missions are frequently carried out with the help of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, the ability to autonomously execute WiSAR remains an unsolved challenge. In this paper, we take advantage of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to develop an autonomous WiSAR controller for UAVs. We improve the learning and understanding of a UAV agent to explore a partially observable environment in search of a victim trapped in the wild. The proposed approach breaks up this difficult problem into 4 sub-tasks: tractable mapping of the environment in small regions, region selection, target search, and region exploration. Quad-Tree is utilized offline to decompose the environment map into smaller, tractable maps. Then, an efficient cost function is repeatedly computed to determine the best target region to search in each iteration of the process. Recurrent-DDQN and A2C algorithms are trained to generate optimal policies for the target search and regions exploration tasks, respectively. We tested our approach against a baseline of a hard-coded policy of navigating the map in a zigzag fashion and another baseline of using the same sub-tasks but instead of using the DRL algorithms, randomly selecting an action at each time step. The results demonstrate that our proposed approach is capable of navigating through 25 randomly generated environments and finding the missing victim faster than the baselines by 46\%.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new evolutionary planner for optimizing the input commands of multiple Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAVs) in target search missions. This planner minimizes the target detection time and maximizes the UAVs performance, given 1) the uncertainty in the target location and sensor information, and 2) the UAV motion and sensorial payload models. On one hand, it calculates the detection time related criteria using Bayesian theory to handle the uncertainty of the problem. On the other hand, it measures the UAVs performance against a real kinematic model that takes into account some environmental effects. Besides, it exploits the typical versatility and good performance of evolutionary algorithms to tackle this search problem as a multi-objective and multi-stepped receding horizon controller, capable of providing acceptable long term (less-myopic) decisions due to a novel optimization criterium that weights the future expected observations with the UAV manoeuvrability constraints. All these properties let it handle successfully the minimum time target detection task in real world scenarios, as the results analyzed in this paper, obtained over different setups, show.},

We further explore the limitations of recurrent PPO by benchmarking the contributed novel environments Mortar Mayhem and Searing Spotlights that challenge the agent's memory beyond solely capacity and distraction tasks. Remarkably, we can demonstrate a transition to strong generalization in Mortar Mayhem when scaling the number of training seeds, while the agent does not succeed on Searing Spotlights, which seems to be a tough challenge for memory-based agents.},

We evaluate several state representation learning methods on goal based robotics tasks and propose a new unsupervised model that stacks representations and combines strengths of several of these approaches. This method encodes all the relevant features, performs on par or better than end-to-end learning with better sample efficiency, and is robust to hyper-parameters change.},

In practice, the unstructured step-based exploration used in Deep RL -- often very successful in simulation -- leads to jerky motion patterns on real robots. Consequences of the resulting shaky behavior are poor exploration, or even damage to the robot. We address these issues by adapting state-dependent exploration (SDE) [1] to current Deep RL algorithms. To enable this adaptation, we propose two extensions to the original SDE, using more general features and resampling the noise periodically, which leads to a new exploration method generalized state-dependent exploration (gSDE). We evaluate gSDE both in simulation, on PyBullet continuous control tasks, and directly on three different real robots: a tendon-driven elastic robot, a quadruped and an RC car. The noise sampling interval of gSDE permits to have a compromise between performance and smoothness, which allows training directly on the real robots without loss of performance.

  abstract = {A field that has directly benefited from the recent advances in deep learning is Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Despite the great achievements of the past decades, however, a natural and robust human-machine speech interaction still appears to be out of reach, especially in challenging environments characterized by significant noise and reverberation. To improve robustness, modern speech recognizers often employ acoustic models based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), that are naturally able to exploit large time contexts and long-term speech modulations. It is thus of great interest to continue the study of proper techniques for improving the effectiveness of RNNs in processing speech signals. In this paper, we revise one of the most popular RNN models, namely Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and propose a simplified architecture that turned out to be very effective for ASR. The contribution of this work is two-fold: First, we analyze the role played by the reset gate, showing that a significant redundancy with the update gate occurs. As a result, we propose to remove the former from the GRU design, leading to a more efficient and compact single-gate model. Second, we propose to replace hyperbolic tangent with ReLU activations. This variation couples well with batch normalization and could help the model learn long-term dependencies without numerical issues. Results show that the proposed architecture, called Light GRU (Li-GRU), not only reduces the per-epoch training time by more than 30\% over a standard GRU, but also consistently improves the recognition accuracy across different tasks, input features, noisy conditions, as well as across different ASR paradigms, ranging from standard DNN-HMM speech recognizers to end-to-end CTC models.},

In these formulations the current best complement to visual features are attributes: manually-encoded vectors describing shared characteristics among categories. Despite good performance, attributes have limitations: (1) finer-grained recognition requires commensurately more attributes, and (2) attributes do not provide a natural language interface. We propose to overcome these limitations by training neural language models from scratch, i.e. without pre-training and only consuming words and characters. Our proposed models train end-to-end to align with the fine-grained and category-specific content of images. Natural language provides a flexible and compact way of encoding only the salient visual aspects for distinguishing categories. By training on raw text, our model can do inference on raw text as well, providing humans a familiar mode both for annotation and retrieval. Our model achieves strong performance on zero-shot text-based image retrieval and significantly outperforms the attribute-based state-of-the-art for zero-shot classification on the Caltech-UCSD Birds 200-2011 dataset.},

We propose a new model, the Generative Adversarial What-Where Network (GAWWN), that synthesizes images given instructions describing what content to draw in which location. We show high-quality 128 x 128 image synthesis on the Caltech-UCSD Birds dataset, conditioned on both informal text descriptions and also object location. Our system exposes control over both the bounding box around the bird and its constituent parts. By modeling the conditional distributions over part locations, our system also enables conditioning on arbitrary subsets of parts (e.g. only the beak and tail), yielding an efficient interface for picking part locations.

Across the UK Police forces have to deal with approximately 1000 enquiries a day relating to missing persons. Current approaches are inherently manual and rely on Police domain knowledge to relate a missing person's behavior to the surrounding geography and terrain. Searches are highly probabilistic, based on a missing person's profile, mental and spatial behavior patterns. Computer support is available, but this is largely in the form of data entry and database systems. This paper describes the CASPER system which is a software application to provide computational support for missing person cases. The CASPER system is essentially a database fronted by a Google Map application. Its strengths lie in the richness of the data and the degree of interaction and information provided through the Map application to enable 'what-if' search scenarios to be elaborated. The paper describes our on-going development of the CASPER system using missing person/suicide data for the Merseyside region in the UK.},

Probabilities can be inferred from the models and missing values can be imputed, based on probability theory. Missing person cases place a strain on the already overstretched resources of Police Forces. Such cases predominantly come from at risk groups such as children in care and people suffering from depression or dementia. Current approaches for dealing with such cases are manual and rely upon empirical studies and domain knowledge. This paper proposes the use of a Bayesian Network model, which can be used to predict the likely location of a missing person (misper) for a number of at risk groups. The model is evaluated using a set of misper cases and results compare very favourably with those of the manual processes currently used by UK Police forces. The novel approach described provides both a theoretical foundation and a practical framework for the future development of a decision support system. In addition to the model, a contribution is made through guidelines, which recount experiences in learning a Bayesian Network from data.},

Even for integrals over non-finite domains, for which several non-finite to finite transformations may be attempted, the algorithm remains very fast.

One of the significant issues for anomaly detection techniques is the availability of labeled data for training/validation of models. In this paper, we proposed a hyper approach based on Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder and One-class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) to detect anomalies based attacks in an unbalanced dataset, by training the models using only examples of normal classes. The LSTM-autoencoder is trained to learn the normal traffic pattern and to learn the compressed representation of the input data (i.e. latent features) and then feed it to an OC-SVM approach. The hybrid model overcomes the shortcomings of the separate OC-SVM, in which its low capability to operate with massive and high-dimensional datasets. Additionally, we perform our experiments using the most recent dataset (InSDN) of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for SDN environments. The experimental results show that the proposed model provides higher detection rate and reduces the processing time significantly. Hence, our method provides great confidence in securing SDN networks from malicious traffic.},

Existing parallel algorithms utilize sequential computations on independent processors, which results in bottlenecks due to the need for data redistribution and processor synchronization. Our algorithm employs a high-throughput approach in which all existing sub-regions are processed and sub-divided in parallel. Repeated sub-region classification and filtering improves upon a brute-force approach and allows the algorithm to make efficient use of computation and memory resources. A CUDA implementation shows orders of magnitude speedup over the fastest open-source CPU method and extends the achievable accuracy for difficult integrands. Our algorithm typically outperforms other existing deterministic parallel methods.},

In this paper, the localization of terrestrial nodes when using mobile unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as aerial anchors is presented. We propose a novel framework to derive localization error in urban areas. In contrast to the existing works, our framework includes height-dependent UAV to ground channel characteristics and a highly detailed UAV energy consumption model. This enables us to explore different trade-offs and optimize UAV trajectory for minimum localization error. In particular, we investigate the impact of UAV altitude, hovering time, number of waypoints and path length through formulating an energy-constrained optimization problem. Our results show that increasing the hovering time decreases the localization error considerably at the cost of a higher energy consumption. To keep the localization error below 100 m, shorter hovering is only possible when the path altitude and radius are optimized. For a constant hovering time of 5 seconds, tuning both parameters to their optimal values brings the localization error from 150m down to 65m with a power saving around 25\% based on our simulation results.},

Due to varying traffic conditions on the highway, a reinforcement learning approach is utilized to govern the number of needed UAVs and their trajectories to serve the existing and newly arriving vehicles. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design and show that during the mission time, a minimum number of UAVs adapt their velocities in order to cover the vehicles.},

Most applications of these models determine these distributions indirectly. We propose a method for directly determining the assumptions of human learners by sampling from subjective prob- ability distributions. Using a correspondence between a model of human choice and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), we describe a method for sampling from the distributions over objects that people associate with different categories. In our task, subjects choose whether to accept or reject a proposed change to an object. The task is constructed so that these decisions follow an MCMC accep- tance rule, defining a Markov chain for which the stationary distribution is the category distribution. We test this procedure for both artificial categories acquired in the laboratory, and natural categories acquired from experience.}

  abstract = {Search and Rescue Operations (SAR) take place in any emergency situation where people are involved and their lives are at risk. These operations are nowadays carried out with the help of advanced technology, such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). In this work, several methods are proposed to calculate the UAV discrete path planning. Previously, an intelligent characterization of the searching area is performed to estimate a potential risk/occupancy degree of the gridding map. This estimation is mainly based on fuzzy logic, considering different factors. Then, four methods are applied to calculate the path planning: an original proposal called attraction, fuzzy logic, ANFIS, and a PSO algorithm. All of them calculate the location of the waypoints to be followed by the UAVs to minimize the distance and the risk the people is exposed to. Then, these strategies are adapted to the possibility of having more than one UAV searching at the same time, and the swarm formation is discussed. Finally, these four solutions for path planning, including different number of UAVs, are tested in a real simulation scenario, and then the performance of each method is analyzed and compared with the others.}

Timeliness is critical: the probability of success decreases substantially after 24 hours. Although over 90\% of searches are quickly resolved by standard ``reflex'' tasks, the remainder require and reward intensive planning. Planning begins with a probability map showing where the lost person is likely to be found. The MapScore project described here provides a way to evaluate probability maps using actual historical searches. In this work we generated probability maps the Euclidean distance tables in (Koester ), and using Doke's () watershed model. Watershed boundaries follow high terrain and may better reflect actual barriers to travel. We also created a third model using the joint distribution using Euclidean and watershed features. On a metric where random maps score 0 and perfect maps score 1, the Euclidean distance model scored 0.78 (95\%CI: 0.74--0.82, on 376 cases). The simple watershed model by itself was clearly inferior at 0.61, but the Combined model was slightly better at 0.81 (95\%CI: 0.77--0.84).},

The two main challenges are the large number of samples typically required, and the difficulty of obtaining stable and steady improvement despite the nonstationarity of the incoming data. We address the first challenge by using value functions to substantially reduce the variance of policy gradient estimates at the cost of some bias, with an exponentially-weighted estimator of the advantage function that is analogous to TD(lambda). We address the second challenge by using trust region optimization procedure for both the policy and the value function, which are represented by neural networks. Our approach yields strong empirical results on highly challenging 3D locomotion tasks, learning running gaits for bipedal and quadrupedal simulated robots, and learning a policy for getting the biped to stand up from starting out lying on the ground. In contrast to a body of prior work that uses hand-crafted policy representations, our neural network policies map directly from raw kinematics to joint torques. Our algorithm is fully model-free, and the amount of simulated experience required for the learning tasks on 3D bipeds corresponds to 1-2 weeks of real time.},

  abstract = {We propose a new family of policy gradient methods for reinforcement learning, which alternate between sampling data through interaction with the environment, and optimizing a "surrogate" objective function using stochastic gradient ascent. Whereas standard policy gradient methods perform one gradient update per data sample, we propose a novel objective function that enables multiple epochs of minibatch updates. The new methods, which we call proximal policy optimization (PPO), have some of the benefits of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test PPO on a collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.},

By making several approximations to the theoretically-justified procedure, we develop a practical algorithm, called Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO). This algorithm is similar to natural policy gradient methods and is effective for optimizing large nonlinear policies such as neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate its robust performance on a wide variety of tasks: learning simulated robotic swimming, hopping, and walking gaits; and playing Atari games using images of the screen as input. Despite its approximations that deviate from the theory, TRPO tends to give monotonic improvement, with little tuning of hyperparameters.},

  abstract = {This paper is a contribution to the theory of the infinitehorizon linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem subject to inequality constraints on the inputs and states, extending an approach first proposed by Sznaier and Damborg [16]. A solution algorithm is presented, which requires solving a finite number of finite-dimensional positive definite quadratic programs. The constrained LQR outlined does not feature the undesirable mismatch between open-loop and closed-loop nominal system trajectories, which is present in the other popular forms of model predictive control (MPC) that can be implemented with a finite quadratic programming algorithm. The constrained LQR is shown to be both optimal and stabilizing. The solution algorithm is guaranteed to terminate in finite time with a computational cost that has a reasonable upper bound compared to the minimal cost for computing the optimal solution. Inherent to the approach is the removal of a tuning parameter, the control horizon, which is present in other MPC approaches and for which no reliable tuning guidelines are available. Two examples are presented that compare constrained LQR and two other popular forms of MPC. The examples demonstrate that constrained LQR achieves significantly better performance than the other forms of MPC on some plants, and the computational cost is not prohibitive for online implementation.},

The training was performed in two training phases and having two data sets. The first phase was the construction of a regression model of the speed of walking. This model predicts the speed of walking of a rescuer who is considered a well-trained and motivated person since the model is fitted on a dataset made of GPS tracking data collected from Mountain Rescue Service rescuers. The second phase is the calibration of the model for lost person speed of walking prediction with transfer learning on lost person data. The model is used in the simulation of walking in all directions to predict the maximum area where a person can be located.

Also, in order to utilize recent advances in machine intelligence and deep learning we need to collect a large amount of annotated training data in a variety of conditions and environments. We present a new simulator built on Unreal Engine that offers physically and visually realistic simulations for both of these goals. Our simulator includes a physics engine that can operate at a high frequency for real-time hardware-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations with support for popular protocols (e.g. MavLink). The simulator is designed from the ground up to be extensible to accommodate new types of vehicles, hardware platforms and software protocols. In addition, the modular design enables various components to be easily usable independently in other projects. We demonstrate the simulator by first implementing a quadrotor as an autonomous vehicle and then experimentally comparing the software components with real-world flights.}

An improved Q-learning reinforcement learning algorithm based on prior knowledge is proposed to solve the problem of slow convergence and low learning efficiency in mobile robot path planning. Prior knowledge is used to initialize the Q-value, so as to guide the agent to move toward the target direction with a greater probability from the early stage of the algorithm, eliminating a large number of invalid iterations. The greedy factor {$\varepsilon$} is dynamically adjusted based on the number of times the agent successfully reaches the target position, so as to better balance exploration and exploitation and accelerate convergence. Simulation results show that the improved Q-learning algorithm has a faster convergence rate and higher learning efficiency than the traditional algorithm. The improved algorithm has practical significance for improving the efficiency of autonomous navigation of mobile robots.},

A population of individuals, which encode the problem solutions are manipulated according to the rule of survival of the fittest through "genetic" operations, such as mutation, crossover and reproduction. A best solution is evolved through the generations. In contrast to evolutionary computation techniques, Eberhart and Kennedy developed a different algorithm through simulating social behavior (R.C. Eberhart et al., 1996; R.C. Eberhart and J. Kennedy, 1996; J. Kennedy and R.C. Eberhart, 1995; J. Kennedy, 1997). As in other algorithms, a population of individuals exists. This algorithm is called particle swarm optimization (PSO) since it resembles a school of flying birds. In a particle swarm optimizer, instead of using genetic operators, these individuals are "evolved" by cooperation and competition among the individuals themselves through generations. Each particle adjusts its flying according to its own flying experience and its companions' flying experience. We introduce a new parameter, called inertia weight, into the original particle swarm optimizer. Simulations have been done to illustrate the significant and effective impact of this new parameter on the particle swarm optimizer.},

Mathematical equations that govern the distribution of organisms were first discovered and developed during the 1960s. The mindset of the engineer is that we can learn from nature. This motivates the application of biogeography to optimization problems. Just as the mathematics of biological genetics inspired the development of genetic algorithms (GAs), and the mathematics of biological neurons inspired the development of artificial neural networks, this paper considers the mathematics of biogeography as the basis for the development of a new field: biogeography-based optimization (BBO). We discuss natural biogeography and its mathematics, and then discuss how it can be used to solve optimization problems. We see that BBO has features in common with other biology-based optimization methods, such as GAs and particle swarm optimization (PSO). This makes BBO applicable to many of the same types of problems that GAs and PSO are used for, namely, high-dimension problems with multiple local optima. However, BBO also has some features that are unique among biology-based optimization methods. We demonstrate the performance of BBO on a set of 14 standard benchmarks and compare it with seven other biology-based optimization algorithms. We also demonstrate BBO on a real-world sensor selection problem for aircraft engine health estimation.},

Areas contained within the region often provide valuable information of varying importance. We present an algorithm to optimally cover a volcanic region in Hawai`i with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The target region is assigned with a nonuniform coverage importance score distribution. For a specified battery capacity of the UAV, the optimization problem seeks the path that maximizes the total coverage area and the accumulated importance score while penalizing the revisiting of the same area. Trajectories are generated offline for the UAV based on the available power and coverage information map. The optimal trajectory minimizes the unspent battery power while enforcing that the UAV returns to its starting location. This multi-objective optimization problem is solved by using sequential quadratic programming. The details of the competitive optimization problem are discussed along with the analysis and simulation results to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed algorithm.},

Optimal path-planning for mobile robotics can play a key role in the reduction of the search time for rescuing victims.

In this paper, a new integrated Reinforcement Learning---based method is proposed to search and find a hidden target in an unknown environment in the minimum time. The proposed algorithm is developed in two main phases. Depending on whether or not the mobile robot receives the signal from the hidden target, phases I or II of the proposed algorithm can be carried out. Then, the proposed algorithm is implemented on an e-puck robot in an urban environment which is simulated within Webots software. Finally, to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method and to verify it, the computational results from the proposed method are compared with three conventional methods from the literature.},

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), one of the most popular and effective unmanned systems, is gradually becoming the vital element of aviation because of its high success rate in both military and civilian missions. Basic problem of UAV is finding the best path in tough environment. Coverage zones of radars and complex environment are the main obstacles in this problem. A UAV intends to travel all control points in an optimal way to be more productive while avoiding radars. In this paper, we used Genetic Algorithm (GA), which is Evolutionary algorithm, to find the optimal flyable path for the UAVs in a 3D environment. Each generation is anticipated to be better than its previous generation in GA. For the purpose of reaching an optimal path, solving the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is one of the major phases in the proposed method. In order to show the visual of solution in better quality, we preferred MATLAB as the implementation environment. Additionally, there is a shared library and mathematical calculations are easier in MATLAB. The complexity of our problem can be increased by adding extra constraints caused by the dynamic environment as the future works. Experimental results show that GA can be opted for optimal path planning for the UAVs.},

However, due to the overwhelming variety of tasks these robots will be expected to complete, providing generic out-of-the-box solutions that meet the needs of every possible user is clearly intractable. To address this problem, robots must therefore not only be capable of learning how to complete novel tasks at run-time, but the solutions to these tasks must also be informed by the needs of the user. In this paper we demonstrate how behaviour trees, a well established control architecture in the fields of gaming and robotics, can be used in conjunction with natural language instruction to provide a robust and modular control architecture for instructing autonomous agents to learn and perform novel complex tasks. We also show how behaviour trees generated using our approach can be generalised to novel scenarios, and can be re-used in future learning episodes to create increasingly complex behaviours. We validate this work against an existing corpus of natural language instructions, demonstrate the application of our approach on both a simulated robot solving a toy problem, as well as two distinct real-world robot platforms which, respectively, complete a block sorting scenario, and a patrol scenario.},

  abstract = {We address the problem of generating feasible paths from a given start location to a goal configuration for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in an obstacle rich environment that consist of static, pop-up and moving obstacles. The UAVs have limited sensor and communication ranges, when they detect a pop-up or a moving obstacle that is in the collision course with the UAV flight path, then it has to replan a new optimal path from its current location to the goal. Determining optimal paths with short time intervals is not feasible, hence we develop anytime algorithm using particle swarm optimization that yields paths whose quality increases with increase in available computation time. To track the given path by the anytime algorithm in 3D, we developed a new uav guidance law that is based on a combination of pursuit guidance law and line of sight guidance law from missile guidance literature. Simulations are carried out to show that the anytime algorithm produces good paths in a relatively short time interval and the guidance law allows the UAVs to track the generated path.},

  abstract = {In real scenarios, state observations that an agent observes may contain measurement errors or adversarial noises, misleading the agent to take suboptimal actions or even collapse while training. In this paper, we study the training robustness of distributional Reinforcement Learning~(RL), a class of state-of-the-art methods that estimate the whole distribution, as opposed to only the expectation, of the total return. Firstly, we validate the contraction of distributional Bellman operators in the State-Noisy Markov Decision Process~(SN-MDP), a typical tabular case that incorporates both random and adversarial state observation noises. In the noisy setting with function approximation, we then analyze the vulnerability of least squared loss in expectation-based RL with either linear or nonlinear function approximation. By contrast, we theoretically characterize the bounded gradient norm of distributional RL loss based on the categorical parameterization equipped with the Kullback-Leibler~(KL) divergence. The resulting stable gradients while the optimization in distributional RL accounts for its better training robustness against state observation noises. Finally, extensive experiments on the suite of environments verified that distributional RL is less vulnerable against both random and adversarial noisy state observations compared with its expectation-based counterpar~(Code is available in https://github.com/datake/RobustDistRL.

Central to trustworthy operation is the ability for the rover to recognise and diagnose abnormal behaviours during its operation. Failure to diagnose faulty behaviour could lead to degraded performance or an unplanned halt in operation. This work investigates a health monitoring method that can be used to improve the capabilities of a fault detection system for a planetary exploration rover. A suite of four metrics, named 'rover vitals', are evaluated as indicators of degradation in the rover's performance. These vitals are combined to give an overall estimate of the rover's 'health'. By comparing the behaviour of a faulty real system with a non-faulty observer, residuals are generated in terms of two high-level metrics: heading and velocity. Adaptive thresholds are applied to the residuals to enable the detection of faulty behaviour, where the adaptive thresholds are informed by the rover's perceived health. Simulation experiments carried out in MATLAB showed that the proposed health monitoring and fault detection methodology can detect high-risk faults in both the sensors and actuators of the rover.},

A map is generated, consisting of a 3D terrain model, traversability analysis, and probability distribution map of points of scientific interest. A three-stage mission planner generates an efficient route, which maximises the accumulated probability of identifying points of interest. A 4D RRT* algorithm is used to determine smooth, flat paths, and prioritised planning is used to coordinate a safe set of paths.

The proposed method tracks position and yaw angle with their derivatives of up to fourth order, specifically, the position, velocity, acceleration, jerk, and snap along with the yaw angle, yaw rate and yaw acceleration. Two key aspects of the proposed method are the following. First, the controller exploits the differential flatness of the quadcopter dynamics to generate feedforward inputs for attitude rate and attitude acceleration in order to track the jerk and snap references. The tracking is enabled by direct control of body torque using closed-loop control of all four propeller speeds based on optical encoders attached to the motors. Second, the controller utilizes the incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion (INDI) method for accurate tracking of linear and angular accelerations despite external disturbances. Hence, no prior modeling of aerodynamic effects is required. We evaluate the proposed control law in experiments under motion capture. Using a 1-kg quadcopter, we are able to track a complex 3D trajectory, reaching speeds up to 8.2 m/s and accelerations up to 2g, while keeping the root-mean-square tracking error down to 4.0 cm, in a flight volume that is roughly 6.5 m long, 6.5 m wide, and 1.5 m tall.},

  abstract = {Wilderness Search and Rescue (WiSAR) operations require navigating large unknown environments and locating missing victims with high precision and in a timely manner. Several studies used deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to allow for the autonomous navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in unknown search and rescue environments. However, these studies focused on indoor environments and used fixed altitude navigation which is a significantly less complex setting than realistic WiSAR operations. This paper uses a DRL-powered approach for WiSAR in an unknown mountain landscape environment. To manage the complexity of the problem, the proposed approach breaks up the problem into five modules: Information Map, DRL-based Navigation, DRL-based Exploration Planner (waypoint generator), Obstacle Detection, and Human Detection. Curriculum learning has been used to enable the Navigation module to learn 3D navigation. The proposed approach was evaluated both under semi-autonomous operations where waypoints are externally provided by a human and under full autonomy. The results demonstrate the ability of the system to detect all humans when waypoints are generated randomly or by a human, whereas DRL-based waypoint generation led to a lower recall of 75\%.},

By using the uniform B-spline to represent trajectories, we transform the trajectory planning to a graph-search problem of B-spline control points in discretized space. Highly strict convex hull property of B-spline is derived to guarantee the dynamical feasibility of the entire trajectory. A novel non-uniform kinodynamic search strategy is adopted, and the step length is dynamically adjusted during the search process according to the Euclidean signed distance field (ESDF), making the trajectory achieve reasonable time-allocation and be away from obstacles. Nonstatic initial and goal states are allowed, therefore it can be used for online local replanning as well as global planning. Extensive simulation and hardware experiments show that our method achieves higher performance compared with the state-of-the-art method.},

  abstract = {The technique of inverse simulation is finding application in many and varied fields. As the name implies this technique is used to calculate the control action required to achieve a specified system response. The field of aircraft flight dynamics is particularly suited to this form of simulation as the question of what control actions must the pilot (or automatic flight control system) take for the aircraft to fly along a particular trajectory (a landing approach, for example) is often asked. This paper looks specifically at the application of inverse simulation in flight dynamics. The aim is not only to give an overview of the various techniques and applications but also to provide guidance to potential users of the technique on several of the physical and numerical features often observed in the results. An extensive review of the methodologies used within the family of inverse simulations is presented followed by a formal treatment of the theoretical development of inverse simulation as an established technique. A case study involving the inverse simulation of a helicopter flying a slalom manoeuvre is presented to demonstrate the application of inverse simulation in a flight dynamics analysis. An important feature of the use of inverse simulation is that it is necessary to define the output response required---in the case of flight dynamics the required flight path has to be modelled. Some of the methods used are documented, and their validity discussed. The paper also gives an insight into the types of problem which can be addressed by inverse simulation by detailing some of the many applications to which it has been put in the past. These include studies of rotorcraft handling qualities, performance and design, and pilot modelling as well as model validation. An important element of this paper is the formal, theoretical analysis of some of the numerical and physical features exhibited by inverse simulation which should aid potential users to interpret their results. The work presented in this paper shows a clear evolution of inverse simulation from its initial days when the mathematical models used were relatively simple into a mature analytical technique able to incorporate state of the art mathematical models and be applied to real flight dynamics problems.},

Distributed data fusion provides a framework for multiple sensors to search for a target and accurately estimate its position. Vision based sensing is employed, using fixed downward-looking cameras. These sensors are modeled to include vehicle state uncertainty and produce an estimate update regardless of whether the target is detected in the frame or not. This allows for a single framework for searching or tracking, and requires non-linear representations of the target position probability density function (PDF) and the sensor model. While a grid-based system for Bayesian estimation was used for the flight demonstrations, the use of a particle filter solution has also been examined. Multi-aircraft flight experiments demonstrate vision-based localization of a stationary target with estimated error co- variance on the order of meters. This capability for real-time distributed estimation will be a necessary component for future research in information-theoretic control.},

Their potential applications for civilian use include door-to-door package delivery, law enforcement, first aid, and emergency services in urban areas, which put the UAVs into obstacle collision risk. Therefore, UAVs are required to be equipped with sensors so as to acquire Artificial Intelligence (AI) to avoid potential risks during mission execution. The AI comes with intensive training of an on-board machine that is responsible to autonomously navigate the UAV. The training enables the UAV to develop humanoid perception of the environment it is to be navigating in. During the mission, this perception detects and localizes objects in the environment. It is based on this AI that this work proposes a real-time three-dimensional (3D) path planner that maneuvers the UAV towards destination through obstacle-free path. The proposed path planner has a heuristic sense of A{$\star$} algorithm, but requires no frontier nodes to be stored in a memory unlike A{$\star$}. The planner relies on relative locations of detected objects (obstacles) and determines collision-free paths. This path planner is light-weight and hence a fast guidance method for real-time purposes. Its performance efficiency is proved through rigorous Software-In-The-Loop (SITL) simulations in constrained-environment and preliminary real flight tests.},

  abstract = {An onboard target detection, tracking and avoidance system has been developed in this paper, for low-cost UAV flight controllers using AI-Based approaches. The aim of the proposed system is that an ally UAV can either avoid or track an unexpected enemy UAV with a net to protect itself. In this point of view, a simple and robust target detection, tracking and avoidance system is designed. Two open-source tools were used for the aim: a state-of-the-art object detection technique called SSD and an API for MAVLink compatible systems called MAVSDK. The MAVSDK performs velocity control when a UAV is detected so that the manoeuvre is done simply and efficiently. The proposed system was verified with Software in the loop (SITL) and Hardware in the loop (HITL) simulators. The simplicity of this algorithm makes it innovative, and therefore it should be used in future applications needing robust performances with low-cost hardware such as delivery drone applications.},

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

Adequate data is usually a prerequisite, especially when deep learning is adopted. However, the development levels of different cities are unbalanced, and still many cities suffer from data scarcity. To address the problem, we propose a novel cross-city transfer learning method for deep spatio-temporal prediction tasks, called RegionTrans. RegionTrans aims to effectively transfer knowledge from a data-rich source city to a data-scarce target city. More specifically, we first learn an inter-city region matching function to match each target city region to a similar source city region. A neural network is designed to effectively extract region-level representation for spatio-temporal prediction. Finally, an optimization algorithm is proposed to transfer learned features from the source city to the target city with the region matching function. Using citywide crowd flow prediction as a demonstration experiment, we verify the effectiveness of RegionTrans. Results show that RegionTrans can outperform the state-of-the-art fine-tuning deep spatio-temporal prediction models by reducing up to 10.7\% prediction error.},

  abstract = {Interacting with the actual environment to acquire data is often costly and time-consuming in robotic tasks. Model-based offline reinforcement learning (RL) provides a feasible solution. On the one hand, it eliminates the requirements of interaction with the actual environment. On the other hand, it learns the transition dynamics and reward function from the offline datasets and generates simulated rollouts to accelerate training. Previous model-based offline RL methods adopt probabilistic ensemble neural networks (NN) to model aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty. However, this results in an exponential increase in training time and computing resource requirements. Furthermore, these methods are easily disturbed by the accumulative errors of the environment dynamics models when simulating long-term rollouts. To solve the above problems, we propose an uncertainty-aware sequence modeling architecture called Environment Transformer. It models the probability distribution of the environment dynamics and reward function to capture aleatoric uncertainty and treats epistemic uncertainty as a learnable noise parameter. Benefiting from the accurate modeling of the transition dynamics and reward function, Environment Transformer can be combined with arbitrary planning, dynamics programming, or policy optimization algorithms for offline RL. In this case, we perform Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) to learn a conservative Q-function. Through simulation experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves or exceeds state-of-the-art performance in widely studied offline RL benchmarks. Moreover, we show that Environment Transformer's simulated rollout quality, sample efficiency, and long-term rollout simulation capability are superior to those of previous model-based offline RL methods.},

First, we incorporate object instance segmentation information, which enables object manipulations such as removing/adding objects and changing the object category. Second, we propose a method to generate diverse results given the same input, allowing users to edit the object appearance interactively.

Motion planning for its multi-Degree of Freedoms (DOFs) manipulator is significant to picking efficiency and fruit quality. However, it is difficult to plan appropriate trajectory for such a complex system. The purpose of this article is to generate smooth trajectories for fruit-picking robot manipulators using shortcuts that are constrained in velocity, acceleration and jerk. The proposed algorithm smooths the robot motion as a post process to trajectory planning. Given an input jerky path, the algorithm will first convert it into a fully synchronized trajectory, and then attempt to reduce the execution time of this trajectory as much as possible while retaining the kinematic motion constraints. The idea of the proposed method is to build shorter and collision-free shortcuts that replace the intermediate motion between two randomly-picked points on the trajectory. Experiments carried on a mobile fruit-picking robot demonstrate that this technique is able to generate smooth and collision-free trajectories for robot manipulators.},

Relying on traditional manual interpretation methods to find a missing person in imagery data sets containing several hundred images is both challenging and time consuming. To better find small signs of missing persons in large UAS datasets, computer assisted interpretation methods have been developed. This article presents the results of an initial evaluation of a computer assisted interpretation method tested against manual methods in a simulated SAR operation. The evaluation performed focused on using resources available to first responders performing SAR operations, specifically: RGB data, volunteers, and a commercially available software program. Results from this field test were mixed, as the traditional group discovered more objects but required more time, in man hours, to discover the objects. Further field experiments, based on the capabilities of current first responder groups, should be conducted to determine to what extent computer assisted methods are useful in SAR operations.},

In this note, we prove certain similarities between this shaping algorithm and the initialization step required for several reinforcement learning algorithms. More specifically, we prove that a reinforcement learner with initial Q-values based on the shaping algorithm's potential function make the same updates throughout learning as a learner receiving potential-based shaping rewards. We further prove that under a broad category of policies, the behavior of these two learners are indistinguishable. The comparison provides intuition on the theoretical properties of the shaping algorithm as well as a suggestion for a simpler method for capturing the algorithm's benefit. In addition, the equivalence raises previously unaddressed issues concerning the efficiency of learning with potential-based shaping.},

DD-PPO is distributed (uses multiple machines), decentralized (lacks a centralized server), and synchronous (no computation is ever stale), making it conceptually simple and easy to implement. In our experiments on training virtual robots to navigate in Habitat-Sim, DD-PPO exhibits near-linear scaling -- achieving a speedup of 107x on 128 GPUs over a serial implementation. We leverage this scaling to train an agent for 2.5 Billion steps of experience (the equivalent of 80 years of human experience) -- over 6 months of GPU-time training in under 3 days of wall-clock time with 64 GPUs. This massive-scale training not only sets the state of art on Habitat Autonomous Navigation Challenge 2019, but essentially solves the task --near-perfect autonomous navigation in an unseen environment without access to a map, directly from an RGB-D camera and a GPS+Compass sensor. Fortuitously, error vs computation exhibits a power-law-like distribution; thus, 90\% of peak performance is obtained relatively early (at 100 million steps) and relatively cheaply (under 1 day with 8 GPUs). Finally, we show that the scene understanding and navigation policies learned can be transferred to other navigation tasks -- the analog of ImageNet pre-training + task-specific fine-tuning for embodied AI. Our model outperforms ImageNet pre-trained CNNs on these transfer tasks and can serve as a universal resource (all models and code are publicly available).},

Using SKI, with local cubic kernel interpolation, we introduce KISS-GP, which is 1) more scalable than inducing point alternatives, 2) naturally enables Kronecker and Toeplitz algebra for substantial additional gains in scalability, without requiring any grid data, and 3) can be used for fast and expressive kernel learning. KISS-GP costs O(n) time and storage for GP inference. We evaluate KISS-GP for kernel matrix approximation, kernel learning, and natural sound modelling.},

  abstract = {The prevalence of maritime transportation and operations is increasing, leading to a gradual increase in drowning accidents at sea. In the context of maritime search and rescue (SAR), it is essential to develop effective search plans to improve the survival probability of persons-in-water (PIWs). However, conventional SAR search plans typically use predetermined patterns to ensure complete coverage of the search area, disregarding the varying probabilities associated with the PIW distribution. To address this issue, this study has proposed a maritime SAR vessel coverage path planning framework (SARCPPF) suitable for multiple PIWs. This framework comprises three modules, namely, drift trajectory prediction, the establishment of a multilevel search area environment model, and coverage search. First, sea area-scale drift trajectory prediction models were employed using the random particle simulation method to forecast drift trajectories. A hierarchical probability environment map model was established to guide the SAR of multiple SAR units. Subsequently, we integrated deep reinforcement learning with a reward function that encompasses multiple variables to guide the navigation behavior of ship agents. We developed a coverage path planning algorithm aimed at maximizing the success rates within a limited timeframe. The experimental results have demonstrated that our model enables vessel agents to prioritize high-probability regions while avoiding repeated coverage.},

This method assumes that specific information regarding to which domain each instance belongs is known. This paper helps to extend the capability of transfer learning for linear regression problems to situations where the domain information is uncertain or unknown; in fact, the framework can be extended to classification problems. For normal datasets, we assume that some latent domain information is available for transfer learning. The instances in each domain can be inferred by different parameters. We obtain this domain information from the distribution of the regression coefficients corresponding to the explanatory variable \$x\$ as well as the response variable \$y\$ based on a Dirichlet process, which is more reasonable. As a result, we transfer not only variable \$x\$ as usual but also variable \$y\$, which is challenging since the testing data have no response value. Previous work mainly overcomes the problem via pseudo-labelling based on transductive learning, which introduces serious bias. We provide a novel framework for analysing the problem and considering this general situation: the joint distribution of variable \$x\$ and variable \$y\$. Furthermore, our method controls the bias well compared with previous work. We perform linear regression on the new feature space that consists of different latent domains and the target domain, which is from the testing data. The experimental results show that the proposed model performs well on real datasets.},

However, hybrid UAVs are rarely used because controller design is challenging due to its complex, mixed dynamics. In this paper, we propose a method to automate this design process by training a mode-free, model-agnostic neural network controller for hybrid UAVs. We present a neural network controller design with a novel error convolution input trained by reinforcement learning. Our controller exhibits two key features: First, it does not distinguish among flying modes, and the same controller structure can be used for copters with various dynamics. Second, our controller works for real models without any additional parameter tuning process, closing the gap between virtual simulation and real fabrication. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed controller both in simulation and in our custom-built hybrid UAVs (Figure 1, 8). The experiments show that the controller is robust to exploit the complex dynamics when both rotors and wings are active in flight tests.},

In this paper, we propose to exploit the underlying structures of the state-action value function, i.e., Q function, for both planning and deep RL. In particular, if the underlying system dynamics lead to some global structures of the Q function, one should be capable of inferring the function better by leveraging such structures. Specifically, we investigate the lowrank structure, which widely exists for big data matrices. We verify empirically the existence of low-rank Q functions in the context of control and deep RL tasks. As our key contribution, by leveraging Matrix Estimation (ME) techniques, we propose a general framework to exploit the underlying low-rank structure in Q functions. This leads to a more efficient planning procedure for classical control, and additionally, a simple scheme that can be applied to any value-based RL techniques to consistently achieve better performance on ``low-rank'' tasks. Extensive experiments on control tasks and Atari games confirm the efficacy of our approach1.},

In the current process of sea search and rescue, the operation efficiency of large search and rescue equipment is low and it cannot provide stable communication link. In this article, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) are used to form a cognitive mobile computing network for co-operative search and rescue, and reinforcement learning (RL) is used to plan search path and improve communication throughput. Based on the scene of marine search and rescue, the grid method is used to model the search and rescue area. Meanwhile, an intragroup communication architecture based on UAVs and USVs is designed to assist intragroup communication by recognizing the link channel state between UAVs. Search and rescue path planning is carried out through the strategy iteration of Markov decision process (MDP). Furthermore, distributed RL is used to recognize the channel state and perform mobile computing, so as to optimize the data throughput in the communication group. The simulation results show that we have successfully completed the path planning task. Compared with conventional methods, RL based on different reward functions has better throughput performance under the same number of UAVs auxiliary communications.},

This problem is not novel, and there have been model-free and model-based algorithms proposed for this problem. However, inspired by recent success in model-free image-based RL, we noticed the absence of a model-free baseline for history-based RL that (1) uses full history and (2) incorporates recent advances in off-policy continuous control. Therefore, we implement recurrent versions of DDPG, TD3, and SAC (RDPG, RTD3, and RSAC) in this work, evaluate them on short-term and long-term PO domains, and investigate key design choices. Our experiments show that RDPG and RTD3 can surprisingly fail on some domains and that RSAC is the most reliable, reaching near-optimal performance on nearly all domains. However, one task that requires systematic exploration still proved to be difficult, even for RSAC. These results show that model-free RL can learn good temporal representation using only reward signals; the primary difficulty seems to be computational cost and exploration. To facilitate future research, we have made our PyTorch implementation publicly available2.},

The goal of cooperative searching problem is to obtain the maximum probability of finding the target during given flight time under various constraints, e.g., obstacle/collision avoidance and simultaneous arrival at the given destination. Hence it is taken as a complicated discrete optimization problem in this paper. First, GMM is utilized to approximate the prior known target probability distribution map, and the searching region is hence decomposed where several subregions representing a cluster of target probability can be extracted. Second, these subregions are prioritized hierarchically by evaluating their Gaussian components obtained from GMM, and then allocated to UAVs aiming to maximize the predicted mission payoff. Third, each UAV visits its allocated subregions sequentially, and the corresponding trajectory is obtained by RHC-based concurrent method. Finally, the proposed method is demonstrated and compared with other methods in the simulated scenario. The simulation results show its high efficiency to solve the cooperative searching problem.},

Based on the parameterized curve segments from GMM, the self-organizing map (SOM) neural network is then established to achieve the coverage search. The step of winner neuron selection in SOM will prioritize and allocate the curve segments to UAVs, with the comprehensive consideration of multiple evaluation factors and allocation balance. The following step of neuron weight update will plan the UAV paths under the constraint of maneuverability and obstacle avoidance, using the modified Dubins guidance vector field. Finally, the good performance of GMM-SOM is evaluated on a coastline map.}

  abstract = {Catching high-speed targets in the flight is a complex and typically highly dynamic task. However, existing methods require manual setting of catching height or time, resulting in lack of adaptability and flexibility and cannot deal with multiple targets. To bridge this gap, we propose a planning-with-decision scheme called catch planner. For sequential decision making, a lightweight policy search method based on deep reinforcement learning is proposed. It is jointly trained with motion planning and decoupled from physics to speed up training. For motion planning, we propose a trajectory optimization method that jointly optimizes the highly coupled catching time and terminal state. The core is the flexible-terminal constraint transcription. It converts the three unique constraints of catching into differentiable metrics, including equality constraints for terminal position and time, and inequality constraints that enable reasonable terminal position offset and attitude relaxation. In addition, sparse parameterization based on MINCO class considers both dynamic feasibility and collision avoidance constraints. As a result, a generally constrained quadrotor planning problem is transformed into an unconstrained optimization that can be solved reliably and efficiently. We also propose an online iterative optimization method for predicting differentiable trajectories of targets. Catch planner provides a new paradigm for the combination of learning and planning, where all algorithms can be run in real-time onboard at 100{\textbackslash}text Hz. Extensive experiments are carried out in real-world and simulated scenes to verify the robustness and expansibility when facing a variety of high-speed flying targets.},

Toward this goal, we first establish a one-to-one solution mapping between MPP and a special type of multiflow network. Based on this equivalence and integer linear programming (ILP), we design novel and complete algorithms for optimizing over each of the four objectives. In particular, our exact algorithm for computing optimal makespan solutions is a first that is capable of solving extremely challenging problems with robot-vertex ratios as high as 100\%. Then, we further improve the computational performance of these exact algorithms through the introduction of principled heuristics, at the expense of slight optimality loss. The combination of ILP model based algorithms and the heuristics proves to be highly effective, allowing the computation of 1.x-optimal solutions for problems containing hundreds of robots, densely populated in the environment, often in just seconds.},

Specifically, the suppression of enemy air defense (SEAD) mission planning is described as a sequential decision-making problem and formalized as a Markov decision process (MDP). Then, the SEAD intelligent planning model based on the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is established and a general intelligent planning architecture is proposed. Furthermore, three policy training tricks, i.e., domain randomization, maximizing policy entropy, and underlying network parameter sharing, are introduced to improve the learning performance and generalizability of PPO. Experiments results show that the model in this work is efficient and stable, and can be adapted to the unknown continuous high-dimensional environment. It can be concluded that the UAV intelligent mission planning model based on DRL has powerful intelligent planning performance, and provides a new idea for researching UAV autonomy.},

The proposed method provides a novel approach in which closing speed and approximate time-to-go terms are used in the reward function to obtain cooperative motion while ensuring no-fly-zones (NFZs) and time-of-arrival constraints. Proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is used in the training phase of the RL agent. System performance is evaluated in two different cases. In case 1, the warfare environment contains only the target area, and simultaneous arrival is desired to obtain the saturated attack effect. In case 2, the warfare environment contains NFZs in addition to the target area and the standard saturated attack and collision avoidance requirements. Particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based cooperative path planning algorithm is implemented as the baseline method, and it is compared with the proposed algorithm in terms of execution time and developed performance metrics. Monte Carlo simulation studies are performed to evaluate the system performance. According to the simulation results, the proposed system is able to generate feasible flight paths in real-time while considering the physical and operational constraints such as acceleration limits, NFZ restrictions, simultaneous arrival, and collision avoidance requirements.

To efficiently solve the problem, we propose a novel reinforcement learning algorithm called the Multi-Agent Attention Model that can solve routing problem instantly benefit from lengthy offline training. Specifically, the vehicle routing problem is regarded as a vehicle tour generation process, and an encoder-decoder framework with attention layers is proposed to generate tours of multiple vehicles iteratively. Furthermore, a multi-agent reinforcement learning method with an unsupervised auxiliary network is developed for the model training. By evaluated on four synthetic networks with different scales, the results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms Google OR-Tools and traditional methods with little computation time. In addition, we validate the robustness of the well-trained model by varying the number of customers and the capacities of vehicles.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose the Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN) which allows attention-driven, long-range dependency modeling for image generation tasks. Traditional convolutional GANs generate high-resolution details as a function of only spatially local points in lower-resolution feature maps. In SAGAN, details can be generated using cues from all feature locations. Moreover, the discriminator can check that highly detailed features in distant portions of the image are consistent with each other. Furthermore, recent work has shown that generator conditioning affects GAN performance. Leveraging this insight, we apply spectral normalization to the GAN generator and find that this improves training dynamics. The proposed SAGAN achieves the state-of-the-art results, boosting the best published Inception score from 36.8 to 52.52 and reducing Frechet Inception distance from 27.62 to 18.65 on the challenging ImageNet dataset. Visualization of the attention layers shows that the generator leverages neighborhoods that correspond to object shapes rather than local regions of fixed shape.},

  abstract = {Efficient path optimization for drones in search and rescue operations faces challenges, including limited visibility, time constraints, and complex information gathering in urban environments. We present a comprehensive approach to optimize UAV-based search and rescue operations in neighborhood areas, utilizing both a 3D AirSim-ROS2 simulator and a 2D simulator. The path planning problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), and we propose a novel "Shrinking POMCP" approach to address time constraints. In the AirSim environment, we integrate our approach with a probabilistic world model for belief maintenance and a neurosymbolic navigator for obstacle avoidance. The 2D simulator employs surrogate ROS2 nodes with equivalent functionality. We compare trajectories generated by different approaches in the 2D simulator and evaluate performance across various belief types in the 3D AirSim-ROS simulator. Experimental results from both simulators demonstrate that our proposed shrinking POMCP solution achieves significant improvements in search times compared to alternative methods, showcasing its potential for enhancing the efficiency of UAV-assisted search and rescue operations.},

  abstract = {Synthesizing high-quality images from text descriptions is a challenging problem in computer vision and has many practical applications. Samples generated by existing text-to-image approaches can roughly reflect the meaning of the given descriptions, but they fail to contain necessary details and vivid object parts. In this paper, we propose Stacked Generative Adversarial Networks (StackGAN) to generate 256x256 photo-realistic images conditioned on text descriptions. We decompose the hard problem into more manageable sub-problems through a sketch-refinement process. The Stage-I GAN sketches the primitive shape and colors of the object based on the given text description, yielding Stage-I low-resolution images. The Stage-II GAN takes Stage-I results and text descriptions as inputs, and generates high-resolution images with photo-realistic details. It is able to rectify defects in Stage-I results and add compelling details with the refinement process. To improve the diversity of the synthesized images and stabilize the training of the conditional-GAN, we introduce a novel Conditioning Augmentation technique that encourages smoothness in the latent conditioning manifold. Extensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-arts on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant improvements on generating photo-realistic images conditioned on text descriptions.},

  abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are becoming more prevalent, more capable, and less expensive every day. Advances in battery life and electronic sensors have spurred the development of diverse UAV applications outside their original military domain. For example, Search and Rescue (SAR) operations stand to benefit greatly from modern UAVs since even the simplest commercial models are equipped with high-resolution cameras and the ability to stream video to a computer or portable device. As a result, autonomous unmanned systems (terrestrial, marine, and aerial) have begun to be employed for such typical SAR tasks as terrain mapping, task observation, and early supply delivery. However, these systems were developed before recent advances in artificial intelligence such as Google Deepmind's breakthrough with the Deep Q-Network (DQN) technology. Therefore, most of them rely heavily on Greedy or Potential-based heuristics, without the ability to learn. In this research, we investigate a possible approximation (called Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes) for enhancing the performance of autonomous UAVs in SAR by incorporating newly-developed Reinforcement Learning methods. The project utilizes open-source tools such as Microsoft's state-of-the-art UAV simulator AirSim, and Keras, a machine learning framework that can make use of Google's popular tensor library called TensorFlow. The main approach investigated in this research is the Deep Q-Network.},
